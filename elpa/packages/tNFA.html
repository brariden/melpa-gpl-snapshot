<h2>Full description</h2><pre>
A tagged, non-deterministic finite state automata (NFA) is an abstract
computing machine that recognises regular languages. In layman's terms,
they are used to decide whether a string matches a regular expression. The
"tagged" part allows the NFA to do group-capture: it returns information
about which parts of a string matched which subgroup of the regular
expression.

Why re-implement regular expression matching when Emacs comes with
extensive built-in support for regexps? Primarily, because some algorithms
require access to the NFA states produced part way through the regular
expression matching process (see the trie.el package for an
example). Secondarily, because Emacs regexps only work on strings, whereas
regular expressions can usefully be used in Elisp code to match other
sequence types, not just strings.

A tagged NFA can be created from a regular expression using
`tNFA-from-regexp', and its state can be updated using
`tNFA-next-state'. You can discover whether a state is a matching state
using `tNFA-match-p', extract subgroup capture data from it using
`tNFA-group-data', check whether a state has any wildcard transitions using
`tNFA-wildcard-p', and get a list of non-wildcard transitions using
`tNFA-transitions'. Finally, `tNFA-regexp-match' uses tagged NFAs to decide
whether a regexp matches a given string.

Note that Emacs' regexps are not regular expressions in the original
meaning of that phrase. Emacs regexps implement additional features (in
particular, back-references) that allow them to match far more than just
regular languages. This comes at a cost: regexp matching can potentially be
very slow (NP-hard in fact, though the hard cases rarely crop up in
practise), whereas there are efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms for
matching regular expressions (in the original sense). Therefore, this
package only supports a subset of the full Emacs regular expression
syntax. See the function docstrings for more information.

This package essentially implements Laurikari's algorithm, as described in
his master's thesis, but it builds the corresponding tagged deterministic
finite state automaton (DFA) on-the-fly as needed.

This package uses the queue package queue.el.
