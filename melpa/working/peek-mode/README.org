* peek-mode
** Introduction
peek-mode is a minor mode that publishes live Emacs buffers through an
[[http://elnode.org/][elnode]] server. This means you can view your emacs buffers in a web
browser as they change. To view buffers, you must /publish/
them. Toggling on peek-mode in a buffer will publish it to the
server. To unpublish a buffer, toggle peek-mode off. (`M-x peek-mode`
does the toggle.)

This behavior is currently most interesting when the buffer you are
peeking at is an HTML buffer. The browser will render the html in real
time as you make changes.

peek-mode is (very very!) largely based on Brian Taylor's
<el.wubo@gmail.com> [[https://github.com/netguy204/imp.el][impatient-mode]] . However, impatient-mode does not
use elnode, but rather a different emacs httpd backend
<https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-http-server>. I consider peek-mode
as "impatient-mode ported to elnode".

** Installation 
*** How to install elnode in less than a minute! 
Assuming you're running GNU Emacs 24+, evaluate the following code in your *scratch* buffer. 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives 
      '("marmalade" .
        "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
  (package-initialize)
#+END_EXAMPLE
  
Now, `M-x package-refresh-contents`. Finally, `M-x package-install RET elnode RET`.
  
Elnode should be installed, and your load-path automatically modified
so that it is accessible. Yay for package managers!

*** peek-mode
Simply clone this repository, make sure peek-mode.el is in your
load-path, and then:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'peek-mode)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Usage
To use peek-mode, two things have to be in place. `peek-mode` must be
enabled in the buffer(s) you want to peek at, and the elnode server
has to be running.

To start the elnode server on port 8008 on your local machine:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (elnode-start 'peek-mode-dispatcher-handler :port 8008 :host "localhost")
#+END_EXAMPLE

To test, try enabling peek-mode in any buffer you have open (see note
in `Limitations` below though).  Just visit a buffer and type `M-x
peek-mode`.

Then launch a web browser, and visit
http://localhost:8008/peek/. There will be a listing of all the
buffers that currently have peek-mode enabled. Click on one to view
it, then go back to emacs and make some changes in that buffer. You
should see the changes immediately reflected in the browser.

** Limitations 
Currently, this only seems to work if your buffer has a file extension
(i.e., a '.' in the buffer name). I'm looking into why. For example,
peek-mode will not work on your \*scratch\* buffer, but it would work on
a buffer called scratch.txt.
