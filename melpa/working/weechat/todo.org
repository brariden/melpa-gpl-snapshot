Note: This list is broken on Github (they should really update
org-ruby). Please use the 'Raw' link on the right.

* Next [4/10]
** TODO Auto-Monitor 'old' buffers
   Sometimes buffers from an earlier connection remain in Emacs, never

   this in a clean way

   This is useful to trigger a reconnect or warn the user when the
   delay gets too big.
