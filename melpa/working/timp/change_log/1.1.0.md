## Inhibit message from redirecting back from child thread

There is a variabel `timp-server-inhibit-message` added to `timp-server`.

If this variable set to nil, messages will not redirect back to parent thread.

In your dark package, you can also do:

``` elisp
(with-timp-server-inhibited-message
    (message "123")
    (message "abc"))
```

The `with-timp-server-inhibited-message` macro temporarily disable message from redirecting back to parent thread.
