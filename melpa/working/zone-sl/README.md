Zone out with steam locomotives
=====================

Zone out with steam locomotives.
This code is based on, and inspired by, https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl.

It can be directly invoked by `M-x zone-sl`.

Or, it can be added to zone programs by using
`zone-select-add-program` of `zone-select` package.

``` common-lisp
  (zone-select-add-program 'zone-pgm-sl)
```
