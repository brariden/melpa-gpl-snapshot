# Overview

Vector-manipulation utility functions for Emacs.

 * [Quickstart](#quickstart)
 * [vector-utils](#vector-utils)
 * [Compatibility and Requirements](#compatibility-and-requirements)
 * [See Also](#see-also)

## Quickstart

```elisp
(require 'vector-utils)
 
(vector-utils-flatten '[1 2 [3 4 [5 6 7]]])
;; '[1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
 
(vector-utils-depth '[1 2 [3 4 [5 6 7]]])
;; 3
```

## vector-utils

Vector-utils is a collection of functions for vector manipulation.
This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful for
programming in Emacs Lisp.

Furthermore (when programming in Emacs Lisp), be aware that the
modification of a vector is not permitted: only vector *elements*
may be changed.  All "modification" operations herein can only
work by making copies, which is not efficient.

The following functions are provided:

	vector-utils-depth
	vector-utils-flatten
	vector-utils-insert-before
	vector-utils-insert-after
	vector-utils-insert-before-pos
	vector-utils-insert-after-pos

To use vector-utils, place the `vector-utils.el` library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your `~/.emacs` file:

```elisp
(require 'vector-utils)
```
