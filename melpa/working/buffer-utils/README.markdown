# Overview

Buffer-manipulation utility functions for Emacs.

 * [Quickstart](#quickstart)
 * [Explanation](#explanation)
 * [Compatibility and Requirements](#compatibility-and-requirements)

## Quickstart

```elisp
(require 'buffer-utils)
 
(buffer-utils-save-order
  (bury-buffer "*scratch*"))
 
;; buffer order is now restored
```

## Explanation

`buffer-utils.el` is a collection of functions for buffer manipulation.

This library exposes very little user-level interface; it is
generally useful only for programming in Emacs Lisp.

To use buffer-utils, place the `buffer-utils.el` library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your `~/.emacs` file:

```elisp
(require 'buffer-utils)
```

The following functions and macros are provided:

	buffer-utils-all-in-mode
	buffer-utils-all-matching
	buffer-utils-bury-and-forget   ; can be called interactively
	buffer-utils-first-matching
	buffer-utils-huge-p
	buffer-utils-in-mode
	buffer-utils-most-recent-file-associated
	buffer-utils-narrowed-p
	buffer-utils-save-order
	buffer-utils-set-order

of which `buffer-utils-save-order` is the most notable.

`buffer-utils-save-order` is a macro, similar to `save-current-buffer`,
which saves and restores the order of the buffer list.
