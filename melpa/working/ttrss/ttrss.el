;;; Commentary:

;; Introduction

;; ttrss.el provides an interface to the Tiny Tiny RSS API. It targets
;; API level 5, and has been developed and tested against version
;; 1.7.5. As such, the versioning on this file tracks that of ttrss
;; itself.  You can read more about Tiny Tiny RSS at
;; <http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki>.

;; Scope

;; The current version of ttrss.el covers all methods as documented at
;; <http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki/JsonApiReference>.
;; It purposefully doesn't offer any additional higher level methods.

;; Installation

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/parent/directory")
;; (require 'ttrss)

;; Usage

;; (setq ttrss-address "http://example.com/ttrss/api/"
;;       ttrss-user "user"
;;       ttrss-password "pass")

;; (let ((ttrss-sid (ttrss-login ttrss-address ttrss-user ttrss-password)))
;;   (if (ttrss-logged-in-p ttrss-address ttrss-sid)
;;       (with-current-buffer (switch-to-buffer "*ttrss reader*")
;; 	(erase-buffer)
;; 	(message "Logged in to %s as %s with password %s\n"
;; 		 ttrss-address
;; 		 ttrss-user
;; 		 ttrss-password)
;; 	(message "Server running version %s and API level %d\n"
;; 		 (ttrss-get-version ttrss-address ttrss-sid)
;; 		 (ttrss-get-api-level ttrss-address ttrss-sid))
;; 	(message "There are %s unread articles in %d feeds"
;; 		 (ttrss-get-unread ttrss-address ttrss-sid)
;; 		 (length (ttrss-get-feeds ttrss-address ttrss-sid :unread_only t)))
;; 	(insert "The grand <b>*ttrss* reader!</b>\n\n---\n\n")
;; 	(mapcar (lambda (pl) (insert (format "%s\n%s\n\n%s\n---\n"
;; 					     (plist-get pl :title)
;; 					     (plist-get pl :link)
;; 					     (plist-get pl :content))))
;; 		(ttrss-get-headlines ttrss-address ttrss-sid :feed_id -3 :limit 3 :show_content t))
;; 	(html2text))
;;     (message "Login failed")))

;; Design

;; I was motivated to write this library to support a new backend for
;; Gnus, 'nnttrss.el'. Its design is kept as functional as possible.
;; That means that it makes no use of global state, amongst other
;; things.

;; TODO

;; * Interactive versions of the methods employing global state:
;;   You'll note that there are, in fact, a number of variables defined
;;   at the top-level, namely 'ttrss-address', 'ttrss-user',
;;   'ttrss-password', 'ttrss-sid', 'ttrss-api-level', and
;;   'ttrss-server-version'. These are defined in anticipation of the
;;   next release, in which I plan to introduce interactive counterparts
;;   of most methods that do employ global state.

;; * variable 'nnttrss-debug':
;;   - Trace methods in the mini-buffer
;;   - Keep a log buffer with requests and responses data structures

;;; Change Log:

;; Version 0.0.1: First public release of this package.
