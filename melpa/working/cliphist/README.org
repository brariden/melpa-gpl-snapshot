* cliphist (v0.3.1)

[[http://melpa.org/#/find-and-ctags][file:http://melpa.org/packages/cliphist-badge.svg]] [[http://stable.melpa.org/#/find-and-ctags][file:http://stable.melpa.org/packages/cliphist-badge.svg]]

Read clipboard history from [[http://parcellite.sourceforge.net/][Parcellite]] on Linux and [[https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut][Flycut]] on OS X.
* Install
The easiest way is install from [[http://melpa.org][melpa]] using package manager.

If you install from source code, please place cliphist.el somewhere (say ~/.emacs/lisp), and insert below code into ".emacs":

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'cliphist)
#+end_src

[[https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el][popup.el]] 5.0 is required as dependency because it provides candidates window by default.

But you can use [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy-mode/Swiper]] instead of popup.el. Install Swiper manually and insert one liner into ~/.emacs,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq cliphist-use-ivy t)
#+end_src

* Usage
Make sure the clipboard manager is running.

- `M-x cliphist-paste-item' to paste item from history
- `M-x cliphist-select-item' to select item

In popup, press `C-n' or `C-p' to navigate, other keys to filter.
* Advanced Tips (OPTIONAL)
** Tip 1
You can customize the behavior of cliphist-select-item,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq cliphist-select-item-callback
      (lambda (num str) (cliphist-copy-to-clipboard str)))
#+end_src
** Tip 2
If `cliphist-cc-kill-ring` is true, the selected/pasted string will be inserted into kill-ring.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq cliphist-cc-kill-ring t)
#+end_src
