** Overview

  =sage-shell-mode= is an elisp package and provides an Emacs front
  end for [[http://www.sagemath.org/][Sage]].

  By =sage-shell-mode=, you can run Sage process in GNU Emacs and send
  contents of a buffer or a file to the Sage process.

  This package also provides a major-mode derived from =python-mode=.

  There are extensions for this package, [[https://github.com/stakemori/auto-complete-sage][auto-complete-sage]], [[https://github.com/stakemori/helm-sage][helm-sage]]
  , [[https://github.com/stakemori/anything-sage][anything-sage]] and [[https://github.com/stakemori/ob-sagemath][ob-sagemath]].

** Requirements

   1. GNU Emacs 24 or later

      As of =sage-shell-mode 0.1.0=, this package requires Emacs 24 or later for lexical closures.

   2. Local install of [[http://www.sagemath.org/][Sage]]

** Installation and Setup

  You can install =sage-shell-mode= from [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa.git][MELPA]].

  1. See http://melpa.org/#/getting-started if you do not have a
     configuration for MELPA.

  2. Install =sage-shell-mode= by
     - =M-x package-refresh-contents=
     - =M-x package-install RET sage-shell-mode=.

  3. You can run Sage inside Emacs by =M-x sage-shell:run-sage= if Emacs
     can find the executable file of Sage.

  If Emacs cannot find the executable file, put the following line to
  =~/.emacs.d/init.el=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (setq sage-shell:sage-root "/path/to/sage/root_directory")
  #+END_SRC

  And replace =/path/to/sage_root_directory= by the root directory of
  Sage, i.e. =$SAGE_ROOT=. If you do not know the root directory of
  Sage, evaluate the following code in Sage:

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
   import os; print os.environ["SAGE_ROOT"]
  #+END_SRC

  Alternatively, instead of setting =sage-shell:sage-root=, you may
    set the variable =sage-shell:sage-executable=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (setq sage-shell:sage-executable "/path/to/sage/executable")
  #+END_SRC

  Here =/path/to/sage/executable= is the path of the executable file
  of Sage.  This may be a symbolic link.

*** Sample configuration
    Here is a sample configuration.

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     ;; Run SageMath by M-x run-sage instead of M-x sage-shell:run-sage
     (sage-shell:define-alias)
     ;; Turn on eldoc-mode
     (add-hook 'sage-shell-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
     (add-hook 'sage-shell:sage-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
    #+END_SRC
** Aliases

  The major mode =sage-mode= and the command =run-sage= are provided
  by [[https://bitbucket.org/gvol/sage-mode/src][sage-mode]] (the official =sage-mode=). To avoid name conflicts,
  =sage-shell-mode= uses redundant names. By putting the following
  code in =~/.emacs.d/init.el=,

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (sage-shell:define-alias)
  #+END_SRC

  the following aliases will be defined.

  | Original name             | Alias          |
  |---------------------------+----------------|
  | sage-shell:run-sage       | run-sage       |
  | sage-shell:run-new-sage   | run-new-sage   |
  | sage-shell:sage-mode      | sage-mode      |
  | sage-shell:sage-mode-map  | sage-mode-map  |
  | sage-shell:sage-mode-hook | sage-mode-hook |

  Then you can run Sage by =M-x run-sage= instead of =M-x
  sage-shell:run-sage= with these aliases.

** Basic Usage

*** Running a Sage process

   You can run Sage by =M-x sage-shell:run-sage=. You can run new Sage
   process by =M-x sage-shell:run-new-sage=.

   | Command                 | Alias        | Description             |
   |-------------------------+--------------+-------------------------|
   | sage-shell:run-sage     | run-sage     | Run a Sage process.     |
   | sage-shell:run-new-sage | run-new-sage | Run a new Sage process. |

   The major-mode of the Sage process buffer is =sage-shell-mode=. The
   basic key-bidings in =sage-shell-mode= are as follows:

   | Key Stroke | Command                                      | Description                                                                     |
   |------------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | RET        | sage-shell:send-input                        | Send the current input to the Sage process.                                     |
   | TAB        | sage-shell-tab-command                       | Complete words at the point or indent a line.                                   |
   | C-d        | sage-shell:delchar-or-maybe-eof              | Delete backward a character or send EOF if there are no inputs.                 |
   | C-c C-c    | sage-shell:interrupt-subjob                  | Interrupt the current subjob.                                                   |
   | M-p        | comint-previous-input                        | Go backward through input history.                                              |
   | M-n        | sage-shell:next-input                        | Go forward through input history.                                               |
   | C-c C-o    | sage-shell:delete-output                     | Delete all outputs since last input.                                            |
   | C-c M-o    | sage-shell:clear-current-buffer              | Delete all outputs in the current buffer. This does not delete the last prompt. |
   | C-c C-l    | sage-shell:load-file                         | Send contents of a file to the Sage process.                                    |
   | C-c C-h    | sage-shell:help                              | Show a document string of a Sage object.                                        |
   | C-c o      | sage-shell:list-outputs                      | List inputs and outputs in a buffer.                                            |
   | C-c M-w    | sage-shell:copy-previous-output-to-kill-ring | Copy the previous output to =kill-ring=                                         |
   For more commands and key-bindings see the help by =M-x
   describle-mode sage-shell-mode=.

*** TAB completion

   By default, =TAB= completion uses =completion-at-point=. You can
   use =pcomplete= by the following setting:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq sage-shell:completion-function 'pcomplete)
   #+END_SRC

   You can also use =auto-complete=, =anything= or =helm= for
   completion.  This requires extensions.

*** Editing a Sage file

   When you visit a file ended with =.sage=, then
   =sage-shell:sage-mode= will be the major-mode of the buffer
   automatically. If you want to edit a file ended with =.py= in
   =sage-shell:sage-mode=, then use the following magic comment at the
   first line of the file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
    # -*- mode: sage-shell:sage -*-
   #+END_SRC

   With aliases above, instead of the line above you can use the
   following magic comment:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
    # -*- mode: sage -*-
   #+END_SRC

   The major mode =sage-shell:sage-mode= is almost same as
   =python-mode= you use. The differences are some of key-bidings.

   The basic key-bidings in =sage-shell:sage-mode= are as follows:

   | Key     | Command                               | Description                             |
   |---------+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
   | C-c C-c | sage-shell-edit:send-buffer           | Send the current buffer to the process. |
   | C-c C-r | sage-shell-edit:send-region           | Send the region to the process.         |
   | C-c C-j | sage-shell-edit:send-line             | Send the current line to the process.   |
   | C-c C-l | sage-shell-edit:load-file             | Send the file to the process.           |
   | C-c C-z | sage-shell-edit:pop-to-process-buffer | Pop to the process buffer.              |

   If you run multiple Sage processes, you can choose which process to
   send by =M-x sage-shell:set-process-buffer=.

** Input history

  If the variable =sage-shell:input-history-cache-file= is =non-nil=
  and it is a file name, then the input history (=comint-input-ring=)
  will be saved to the file. Here is a sample configuration:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq sage-shell:input-history-cache-file "~/.emacs.d/.sage_shell_input_history")
  #+END_SRC

** SageTeX
*** TEXINPUTS

   When a Sage process is spawned by =sage-shell:run-sage= or
   =sage-shell:run-new-sage=, then =sage-shell-mode= adds
   =$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex/= to the
   environment variable =TEXINPUTS= in Emacs. If you do not want to
   change the environment variable, set
   =sage-shell-sagetex:add-to-texinputs-p= to =nil=.

*** Commands for SageTeX

   Here is a list of commands for =SageTeX=. These commands load a
   =.sagetex.sage= file generated by =SageTeX= to the existing Sage
   process.

   | Command                                    | Run =latex= before loading | Run =latex= after loading |
   |--------------------------------------------+----------------------------+---------------------------|
   | sage-shell-sagetex:load-file               | No                         | No                        |
   | sage-shell-sagetex:run-latex-and-load-file | Yes                        | No                        |
   | sage-shell-sagetex:compile-file            | Yes                        | Yes                       |

   There are similar commands to above,
   =sage-shell-sagetex:load-current-file=,
   =sage-shell-sagetex:run-latex-and-load-current-file= and
   =sage-shell-sagetex:compile-current-file=.

   Here is a sample setting for =AUCTeX= users.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (eval-after-load "latex"
      '(mapc (lambda (key-cmd) (define-key LaTeX-mode-map (car key-cmd) (cdr key-cmd)))
             `((,(kbd "C-c s c") . sage-shell-sagetex:compile-current-file)
               (,(kbd "C-c s C") . sage-shell-sagetex:compile-file)
               (,(kbd "C-c s r") . sage-shell-sagetex:run-latex-and-load-current-file)
               (,(kbd "C-c s R") . sage-shell-sagetex:run-latex-and-load-file)
               (,(kbd "C-c s l") . sage-shell-sagetex:load-current-file)
               (,(kbd "C-c s L") . sage-shell-sagetex:load-file)
               (,(kbd "C-c C-z") . sage-shell-edit:pop-to-process-buffer))))
   #+END_SRC

   For example, you can run =sage-shell-sagetex:compile-current-file=
   by =C-c s c= in a =LaTeX-mode= buffer with this setting.

*** Customize =latex= command

   You can change a =latex= command used by
   =sage-shell-sagetex:compile-file= and
   =sage-shell-sagetex:compile-current-file= by setting
   =sage-shell-sagetex:latex-command= or
   =sage-shell-sagetex:auctex-command-name=.

   If you are an =AUCTeX= user, then customize
   =sage-shell-sagetex:auctex-command-name= to change the =latex=
   command.  The value of =sage-shell-sagetex:auctex-command-name=
   should be a =name= of a command in =TeX-command-list= (i.e =car= of
   an element of the list =TeX-command-list=), e.g.:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq sage-shell-sagetex:auctex-command-name "LaTeX")
   #+END_SRC

   You can also use the variable =sage-shell-sagetex:latex-command= to
   change the =latex= command. For example, if you want to run
   =latexmk= after loading a =.sagetex.sage= file, then use the
   following setting:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq sage-shell-sagetex:latex-command "latexmk")
   #+END_SRC

   The default value of =sage-shell-sagetex:latex-command= is =latex
   -interaction=nonstopmode=. If
   =sage-shell-sagetex:auctex-command-name= is =non-nil=, then the
   value of =sage-shell-sagetex:latex-command= is ignored.

** Customization

  To customize =sage-shell-mode=, =M-x customize-group RET sage-shell=
  or =M-x customize-group RET sage-shell-sagetex=.

** Workaround for flycheck

  To use =flycheck-mode= in a =sage-shell:sage-mode= buffer and a
  =python-mode= buffer, try the following code.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (dolist (ckr '(python-pylint python-flake8))
      (flycheck-add-mode ckr 'sage-shell:sage-mode))

    (defun sage-shell:flycheck-turn-on ()
      "Enable flycheck-mode only in a file ended with py."
      (when (let ((bfn (buffer-file-name)))
              (and bfn (string-match (rx ".py" eol) bfn)))
        (flycheck-mode 1)))

    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'sage-shell:flycheck-turn-on)
  #+END_SRC
