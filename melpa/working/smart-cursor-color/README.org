* smart-cursor-color-mode 
Change cursor-color dynamically on Emacs.
[[http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home][iTerm2]] have `smart cursor color'.
But GNU Emacs doesn't have this option.
The `smart-cursor-color-mode' can make do that.

** Quickstart
To make the mode enabled every time Emacs starts, add the following
to Emacs initialisation file (~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el):

- If installed from [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (smart-cursor-color-mode +1)
#+END_SRC

- If installed manually,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "path-to-installed-directory")
  (require 'smart-cursor-color)
  (smart-cursor-color-mode +1)
#+END_SRC

When hl-line-mode is on,
smart-cursor-color-mode is not work.
So must turn off hl-line-mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (hl-line-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

But when global-hl-line-mode is on,
smart-cursor-color-mode is work.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-hl-line-mode +1)
  (smart-cursor-color-mode +1)
#+END_SRC
