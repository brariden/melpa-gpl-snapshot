Correcting words with flyspell via custom interface.

[[http://d12frosted.github.io/posts/flyspell-correct-intro.html][Read intro post]]

To use set the value of ~flyspell-correct-interface~ to any of available
interfaces (predefined are ~flyspell-correct-ivy~, ~flyspell-correct-helm~ and
~flyspell-correct-popup~). For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq flyspell-correct-interface 'flyspell-correct-ivy)
#+END_SRC

After that, just call ~flyspell-correct-word-generic~ with cursor on misspelled word. You
can also bind it by adding this to your ~init.el~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key flyspell-mode-map (kbd "C-;") 'flyspell-correct-word-generic)
#+END_SRC

When invoked, it will show the list of corrections suggested by Flyspell. ~ivy~,
~helm~ and ~popup~ also allows to save unknown word to your dictionary, accept this
spelling in current buffer or whole session.

* Custom interfaces

One can easily implement custom interface for ~flyspell-correct-word-generic~. It
has to be function that takes two arguments - candidates and misspelled word. It
has to return either replacement word or ~(command, word)~ tuple that will be
passed to ~flyspell-do-correct~. Check ~flyspell-correct-popup~ for example of
interface that uses this feature.
