#+title: Parens and Pipes

* From Bars and Pipes.  The best sequencer I never got to use.

* Ideas
** Lispy without being too scary (but enough to get them addicted to paren-crack)
** Intellisensey and self documenting.  Every command every arg must be documented.
** Std in, out and error.  Pipes etc.
** should be able to hold on to the last input, easily stash it, etc.
   (cat filename) -> lotsa output
   (head ,it)   [i hate the ,it syntax]
