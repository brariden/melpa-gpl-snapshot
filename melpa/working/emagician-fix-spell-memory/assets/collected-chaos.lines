ON PRAYER

Mal-2 was once asked by one of his Disciples if he often prayed to Eris. He
replied with these words:

No, we Erisians seldom pray, it is much too dangerous. Charles Fort has
listed many factual incidences of ignorant people confronted with, say, a
drought, and then praying fervently -- and then getting the entire village
wiped out in a torrential flood.

       The Law of Fives

    the Law of Fives is one of the oldest Erisian Mysterees. It was first
revealed to Good Lord Omar and is one of the great contributions to come from
The Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus.
    POEE subscribes to the Law of Fives of Omar's sect. And POEE also
recognizes the holy 23 (2+3=5) that is incorporated by Episkopos Dr. Mordecai
Malignatus, KNS, into his Discordian sect, The Ancient Illuminated Seers of
Bavaria. 
    The Law of Fives states simply that: ALL THINGS HAPPEN IN FIVES, OR
ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY APPROPRIATE TO 5.
    The Law of Fives is never wrong.
    In the Erisian Archives is an old memo from Omar to Mal-2: "I find the
Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look."

              CONVENTIONAL CHAOS

GREYFACE

In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of
Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as
he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted
the ways of Serious Order. "Look at all the order around you," he
said. And from that, he deluded honest men to believe that reality was
a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it.

It is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that
particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the
disorder around them and conclude just the opposite. But anyway,
Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more
seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy
other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.

The unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been
suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance. Imbalance causes
frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear makes for a bad trip. Man
has been on a bad trip for a long time now.

It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

    One day Zarathud took his students to a pleasant pasture and there he
confronted The Sacred Chao while She was contentedly grazing.

    "Tell me, you dumb beast." demanded the Priest in his commanding voice,
"why don't you do something worthwhile. What is your Purpose in Life, anyway?"

    Munching the tasty grass, The Sacred Chao replied "MU".*

    Upon hearing this, absolutely nobody was enlightened. Primarily because
nobody could understand Chinese.

Grey Book Texts - I
To say in day-to-day life that something is "obvious" means, more often than not, that one concedes a note of truth in exchange for a tolerance of the usual hypocrisy and conditioning. You can, for example, make your opposite admit as being obvious that there is no such thing as a theory that is absolutely true; that will not stop them in any way from continuing to brandish their "Truths" as before.
Hence, there is no higher aim than the OBVIOUS. It is to approach the closest to a Truth which we know to be inaccessible but whose gleam we can see.
The Obvious is a protection. Not only does it make people run away, but it also deceives by its rapid commonness, and by the fact that in Flat people's minds, whatever is simple cannot be serious.

Grey Book Texts - II
An Individual has many personalities or characters at the same time or alternately. (Recent cognitive brain theory supports this.) 
Most people little by little eliminate the personalities considered to be dangerous by their peer group or societal unit and finally keep only one: the social personality... one-dimensional "FLAT" people. But other people, called paradoxically "Individuals", are always trying to develop all their personalities, even if there is an internal conflict between them. So we can clearly see that the Individualist person logically must use "WE" to name himself, whilst the person who belongs to the masses must use the "I". The first is multi-dimensional, the second is uni-dimensional.
One of the Temple functions is to encourage and support the development of multi-dimensional Individuals. Hence our use of "WE" in our texts.
Our enemies are Flat.

Grey Book Texts - III
Our stress on SELF discipline is important, it links the internal methods of ritual to our approval and suggestion of other forms of physical discipline to complement the mental/sexual ones. Hence you will often find that Initiates of the Temple will be engaged in such outside activities as Marksmanship, Martial Arts, Swimming and so on as an extension of the theory of maintaining and improving one's focus and abilities.
The point is not the skill in itself, though we appreciate the practical nature, in a society such as ours, of an Ability to defend oneself and be fit, but the APPLICATION, the discipl1ne itself. So one may be poor in terms of results, but excellent in terms of your genuine application to a skill that requires thought, co-ordination and a degree of dedication. A synthesis of physical action, thought, reflex and an analysis of both yourself and a target (real or metaphysical.
