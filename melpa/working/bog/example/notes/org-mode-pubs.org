#+startup: showall

Before you start, tell Bog where things are.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq bog-notes-directory (expand-file-name "./")
        bog-bib-directory (expand-file-name "../bibs")
        bog-file-directory (expand-file-name "../citekey-files")
        bog-stage-directory) (expand-file-name "../stage")
#+end_src

Now start Bog with =M-x bog-mode= or

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (bog-mode 1)
#+end_src

The rest of this file is an example of how notes can be structured.

* Books

** dominik2010org

The Org Mode 7 Reference Manual - Organize your life with GNU Emacs

http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1952135

The BibTeX files are stored in =bog-bib-directory=.  You can open the
file for the current heading with =bog-find-citekey-bib= (=C-c " b=).

* Reproducible research

** hinsen2011data

A data and code model for reproducible research and executable papers

doi:10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.061

A new BibTeX file for this citekey has been downloaded to
=bog-stage-directory=.  To prepare this file (and any other BibTeX
file in that directory), run =bog-clean-and-rename-staged-bibs=.

The BibTeX mode settings below make the automatically generated
citekey match Bog's citekey format.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq bibtex-autokey-year-length 4
        bibtex-autokey-titleword-length nil
        bibtex-autokey-titlewords-stretch 0
        bibtex-autokey-titlewords 1
        bibtex-autokey-year-title-separator "")
#+end_src

** TODO schulte2011active

Active documents with Org-mode

doi:10.1109/MCSE.2011.41

A file associated with this citekey has been downloaded to
=bog-stage-directory=.  To associate that file with this heading, run
=bog-rename-staged-file-to-citekey= (=C-c " r=).

That file is now stored in =bog-file-directory= and can be opened with
=bog-find-citekey-file= (=C-c " f=).

** schulte2012multi

A multi-language computing environment for literate programming and
reproducible research

After a title and URL (neither of which are necessary), there will
usually be notes about the paper.  To refer to another study, just
insert the citekey name, such as dominik2010org.  This is just normal
text, but many Bog commands treat it as special.  Put your point on
dominik2010org, and run =bog-open-first-citekey-link= (=C-c " l=).

Notes do not have to be limited to a single file.  name1990word is a
study in another notes file.  Place the point on name1990word and run
=bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-notes= (=C-c " H=) to jump to that
heading.

Look at the other commands by pressing =C-c " C-h=.
