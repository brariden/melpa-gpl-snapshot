Basic faust syntax colorizer for emacs.
Totally bad programmed, but now it colorizes.
If you can do it better, please do it! :-)

Put the faust-mode.el in your site-lisp folder
and add this to your .emacs:

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.dsp$" . faust-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'faust-mode "faust-mode" "FAUST editing mode." t)
