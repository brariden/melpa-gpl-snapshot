* Lemon mode

A major mode for editing LEMON Parser Generator grammar files.

** What's this?

[[http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/][Lemon]] is a simple but very powerful parser generator for C/C++. This
major mode will help you for editing Lemon's grammar files in the
Emacs editor.

Two major mode =lemon-c-mode= and =lemon-c++-mode=, which
lemon-mode.el provides, allow you to explicitly specify the base
editing mode that affects syntax highlighting and indentation
mechanism.

** Usage

Place =lemon-mode.el= in a directory in your emacs's =load-path=.

: (require 'lemon-mode)

Then invoke =lemon-mode= (which is identical to =lemon-c-mode=) in the
buffer where lemon grammar file is extracted.

Optionally, you can bind lemon-mode to the files with certain
extensions.

: (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.y$" . lemon-mode))
