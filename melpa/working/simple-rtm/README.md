Overview
--------

This is an interactive "do everything right now" kind of interface to
Remember The Milk (RTM). Upon start it will query RTM for all of your
lists and incomplete tasks and show them. Each list can be expanded
and collapsed. Tasks can be acted upon with single key strokes. These
key strokes are modeled after RTM's JavaScript based web interface.

You can mark tasks and act upon multiple tasks at once. However, only
marked tasks that are currently visible (meaning that the list they
belong to is expanded) are considered when taking any action. If no
visible task is maked then the task at point is acted upon.

For a complete list of supported actions please see the mode's help.

There's also a global minor mode called
"display-simple-rtm-tasks-mode". It can show a customizable string in
the mode line that includes counts of certain task types. It defaults
to displaying the number of due tasks. See the online help for the
function "display-simple-rtm-tasks-mode" and the variable
"simple-rtm-task-line-format".

For more infomation see
[the Remember The Milk website](http://www.rememberthemilk.com).

Installation
------------

Add the following to your startup file:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/simple-rtm/lisp")
    (autoload 'simple-rtm-mode "simple-rtm" "Interactive mode for Remember The Milk" t)

Then start it with:

    (simple-rtm-mode)

If you want to turn on the task count in the mode line then you can
use these lines:

    (eval-after-load 'simple-rtm
      '(progn
         (display-simple-rtm-tasks-mode t)))

Remember The Milk requires all applications to be authenticated by the
user before they can access the user's data. The first time SimpleRTM
starts and connects to Remember The Milk it will tell you to open a
specific URL. Copy &amp; paste this URL into a browser or your choice,
follow the instructions on the screen, return to Emacs and press
enter.

Limitations
-----------

This mode will not sync with org-mode. I don't use org-mode, and this
package is tailored for immediate modification of tasks. Please don't
ask for offline/sync functionality or org-mode integration.  See the
original project SimpleRTM started from for a solution:
[slack-rtm](https://github.com/slackorama/slack-rtm)

Anything available from RTM's "settings" section will not be
supported. Meaning you will not be able to e.g. create lists with
SimpleRTM.

Known issues
------------

* Smart lists don't work yet. Therefore they're not shown.
* Repeating tasks are completely untested and unsupported.
* Tag tab completion only works with smart-add, not when editing them afterward.
* Subtasks arne't supported.

Planned features
----------------

* Make fewer calls to RTM after each action (parse and integrate each
  call's result instead of reloading all tasks).

Bugs and issues
---------------

If you find bugs not addressed here please open an issue in
[SimpleRTM's issue tracker](https://github.com/mbunkus/simple-rtm/issues).
