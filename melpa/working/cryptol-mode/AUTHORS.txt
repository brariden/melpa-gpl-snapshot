If you're not mentioned above but would like to be, please contact me.

Part of the comint integration was lightly taken from `haskell-mode`,
which has been contributed to by many people over the years.

A very special thanks must go to both Sean Weaver and Galois Inc in particular.
They have graciously provided me an up-to-date Cryptol license, allowing the
support of both the commercial and academic communities. Their contributions
are invaluable.
