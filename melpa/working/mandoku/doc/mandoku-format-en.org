#+TITLE: The =Mandoku= text format
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil ^:nil

Conventions for the text format used by =Mandoku= are made up of three parts:
  - Emacs org-mode format
  - convention about how texts are organized into files
  - Additional syntactical conventions singular to =Mandoku= within the files

* The text format is based on Emacs org-mode

  The text editor Emacs has the concept of "modes", which allows for
  specialized modes of editing depending on the type of text to be
  edited. This works for various programming languages and helps the
  programmer to avoid mistakes by giving graphical hints through
  formatting and colors and in general support the task of writing in
  this language.  

  Emacs org-mode (see [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode: Your Life in Plain Text]][orgmode.org]) builds on
  this concept, but the target is not a specific programming language
  but plain text with some outlining, formatting and hyperlinking
  conventions.  This makes it a lightweight text format that covers
  some middle ground between absolutely complete plain text (if such a
  thing exists) and complex markup languages like XML.  Since it even
  supports footnotes and is easily converted to HTML, Latex and
  OpenOffice format, it is useable even for research articles.

  To make this possible, org-mode introduces a few special markup
  constructs. Some of the assumptions of this plain text according to
  org-mode are as follows:

  - Headings of all kinds are expressed by placing stars "* " in the
    leftmost column of the text. The number of stars indicates the
    level of the heading in the overall outline of the document. The
    stars have to be followed by a space in order to be recognized as
    a part of the outline. Structurally, a heading defines a
    subsection.
: * Outline level one レベル１の見出し
: ** Outline level two レベル２の見出し
: *** Outline level three レベル３の見出し
  - following a heading a socalled "property drawer" may appear; this
    is a container for additional information associated with the
    subsection.
: * Introduction
:  :PROPERTIES:
:  :CUSTOM_ID: intro
:  :END:
  - Headings can also have "tags" attached to them, which marks them
    for example for various analytical purposes, they appear on the
    headline towards the right margin.
: * Outline level one レベル１の見出し	      :important:
  - Paragraphs are indicated by at least one empty line.
  - Distinctive parts of the text, for example quotations or parts in
    verse can be set apart using a specific section marker:
: 即於佛前以偈頌曰。
: #+BEGIN_VERSE
: 目淨脩廣如青蓮
: 心淨已度諸禪定
: 久積淨業稱無量
: 導眾以寂故稽首
: #+END_VERSE
  - Lines beginning with a pound sign '#' are treated specially, not as part of the text:
    - if followed by a "+" they introduce special keywords or syntax
      used for org-mode's own purposes, for example =#+TITLE=,
      =#+AUTHOR= or =#+DATE=. 
    - the pound sign followed by a space character "# " introduces a
      comment which is not considered part of the document.
  - Links to other files target.txt or places within the current file
    are constructed like this: =[[target.txt][link to target.txt] ]=


* Additional conventions for =Mandoku=


** Text identifiers
   As of September 2013, Mandoku switched to a new type of text
   identifiers. This identifier, such as =KR6i0076= is composed of three parts:
   - "KR", which is the repository identifier -- this indicates the origin of the text
   - "6i", which indicates in which subcollection the text is found,
     in this case "經集部類", which is part of the top-level grouping
     "6 佛部".
   - "0076" which is the serial number of the text in the collection.

   Most texts of the part "6 佛部" of the KR repository do derive from
   the CBETA collection of Buddhist texts, which has a different set
   of text identifiers, in this case, the text in question has the
   title "維摩詰所說經" and the CBETA identifier =T14n0475=, this was
   also used in =Mandoku= in previous versions.

** About texts, versions and editions

   In =Mandoku= every text has a text identifier, for example
   =KR6i0076==, which uniquely identifies the text within a larger
   collection and makes it possible to refer to it unambiguoqusly.
   This identifier is usually also the name of the folder, where all
   files that make up a text are stored. The text is usually split up
   so that one file has the content of one scroll, and they are
   numbered in sequence.  An additional file may give the table of
   contents with links to the appropriate location in the files.

: KR6i0076_000.txt
: KR6i0076_001.txt
: KR6i0076_002.txt
: KR6i0076_003.txt
: KR6i0076.org


   The source of the text has to be given (at the beginning of the
   file, this is recorded with the property keyword "WITNESS") and
   there might also be a base edition (keyword "BASEEDITION"). The
   base edition provides the navigation grid for all editions of a
   text.

   Several editions of a text might be recorded; this allows the
   documentation of textual witnesses for a text and provides the
   ground for critical editions of the text. Within =Mandoku=,
   different editions (witnesses) of a text are stored as "branches"
   in a version control system.

   In order to provide a common reference system common to all
   editions of a text, page numbers and locations of the line break of
   the base edition are recorded in all files. Editions that have a
   different layout may additionally record the page numbers according
   to the source edition.


** Syntactic conventions

*** Base edition and text witness
   In =Mandoku= some import information about the source and
   edition of a text can be given at the beginning of a file in machine
   readable form, for example:

: #+PROPERTY: BASEEDITION T
: #+PROPERTY: ID KR6i0076
: #+PROPERTY: CBETA_ID T14n0475
: #+PROPERTY: WITNESS 【CBETA】
: #+PROPERTY: JUAN 1

  Here the base edition is identified as "T" and the witness (the
  edition in this file) is given as "【CBETA】".  In addition, the
  identification number of the text is recorded and the number of the
  juan. As mentioned above, the text identifiers have been changed
  recently, therefore the previously used CBETA_ID is also given for
  reference.

*** Page numbers
  The page number is given in the following form:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<pb:KR6i0076_T_0537a>
#+END_EXAMPLE

  There are three parts to this number, separated by the "_"
  character, surrounded by the page break indicator "<pb: .. >":
  - "KR6i0076" is the identification number of the text
  - "T" is the identifier of the edition
  - "0537a" is the page number ("a" stands for the upper part of the
    text or the first half of a page in woodblock prints that are
    separated in two halves) At the moment =Mandoku= requires the page
    number to end in a letter.

  The page break indicator "<pb:" referes always to the witness
  documented in the current file, if this differs from the base
  edition, then the reference to the base edition can be given with
  "<md:", that is "pb" is replaced by "md".

*** Line break indicators
    To facilitate navigation in the text, =Mandoku= records the line
    breaks of the source edition.  Together with the page numnbers,
    they provide a grid of coordinates that is used to address
    locations in the text.  To mark the occurrence of a line break, a
    line break indicator "¶" is simply inserted at the appropriate
    location in the text:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
復有萬梵天王尸棄等，從餘四天下，來詣¶
佛所，而聽法；復有萬二千天帝，亦從餘四¶
天下，來在會坐；并餘大威力諸天、龍神、夜¶
叉、乾闥婆、阿脩羅、迦樓羅、緊那羅、摩睺羅¶
伽等，悉來會坐。
#+END_EXAMPLE

    This makes it possible to reformat the text in phrases without
    losing the navigation grid:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
復有萬梵天王尸棄等，
從餘四天下，
來詣¶佛所，
而聽法；
復有萬二千天帝，
亦從餘四¶天下，
來在會坐；
并餘大威力諸天、
龍神、
夜¶叉、
乾闥婆、
阿脩羅、
迦樓羅、
緊那羅、
摩睺羅¶伽、
等悉來會坐。
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Inline notes

    Notes that are in the original text marked as notes through
    half-size characters on smaller lines are placed within
    parentheses "(" and ")".

*** Additions to the text
    By convention, =Mandoku= considers only the characters from the
    beginning of the line up to the first TAB character (U+0009) as
    part of the source text. Annotations or a translation can be
    placed to the right of the TAB character without influencing the
    navivational grid.  Here is an example with a translation added[fn::The translation is by the late John R. McRae, published in the BDK Tripitaka series, Berkeley 2004.]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
復有萬梵天王尸棄等。　　　　　　5. There were also ten thousand Brahmā heavenly kings, Śikhin and others, 
從餘四天下來詣¶佛所而聽法。　　who descended from the other worlds of four continents to proceed to where the Buddha was in order to hear the Dharma. 
復有萬二千天帝。　　　　　　　　There were also twelve thousand heavenly emperors (i.e., Indras), 
亦從餘四¶天下來在會坐。　　　　who also came from the other worlds of four continents to sit in this assembly, 
并餘大威力諸天．　　　　　　　　and the other awesomely powerful gods (devas), 
龍神．　　　　　　　　　　　　　dragons (nāgas), 
夜¶叉．　　　　　　　　　　　　yakṣas, 
乾闥婆．　　　　　　　　　　　　gandharvas, 
阿脩羅．　　　　　　　　　　　　asuras, 
:zhu:
阿脩羅 [a1xiu1luo1] skt Asura, deities of the lowest rank.
:END:
迦樓羅．　　　　　　　　　　　　garuḍas, 
緊那羅．　　　　　　　　　　　　kiṃnaras, 
摩睺羅¶伽．　　　　　　　　　　and mahoragas, 
等悉來會坐。　　　　　　　　　who all came to sit in the assembly. 
#+END_EXAMPLE

    Additionally, annotations can be placed in socalled "drawers" (of
    which the property drawer above is one example) on lines by
    themselves.  =Mandoku= defines a drawer called "zhu" for
    annotation, informal notes etc. pertaining to certain characters
    or expressions, they are understood to refer to the previous line
    in the file. Drawers are introduced with the convention :<name of
    drawer>: on a line by themselves and are ended with :END: again on
    a line by themselves. In interactive use, the content of drawers
    can be hidden and made to appear only when needed.
