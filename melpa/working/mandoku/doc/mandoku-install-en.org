* Installing the bundle version of Mandoku

  Mandoku for Windows is now distributed as a bundle, which includes
  all needed software in one archive file. This now is much more
  complete than the previous versions.  Much work has been invested in
  making the installation procedure more smooth, so as to enable more
  people to use it.

  On other platforms, most of the required files are already installed
  or can be used as originally distributed; only the Emacs packages
  needed for the operation, including Mandoku, need to be installed as
  described below.


  Requirements:
  - On all platforms, =git= and =python= are required for the
    installation process and software updates, to run the program of
    course Emacs is also needed. 
  - A working network connection
  - About 400 MB of free space on the system harddisk

** Installing a bundle for Windows

   The bundle for Windows has been tested on Windows 8 and 10.  It
   might work on earlier versions, but there might also be problems.
   Currently there is no 32 bit version of the package. The Emacs
   application included in the =Mandoku= package below is version 24.5
   from [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chuntaro/NTEmacs64/master/emacs-24.5-IME-patched.zip][the NTemacs project]], this is known to work with the input
   methods for Chinese and Japanese.
   
   1. The =Mandoku= bundle includes a version of the =git=
      program, which is used to download and update necessary
      files. If you want to use =git= outside of =Mandoku=, it is
      recommended to download and install the =git= software from the
      [[https://git-for-windows.github.io/][Git for Windows]] software
      repository. The current version known to work is v2.7.2.

   2. Download the =Mandoku= installation bundle
      [[file:data/mandoku-2016-03.zip][mandoku-2016-03.zip]]
      (200MB).
   3. Doubleclick on the package and move the folder =krp=, which is
      found inside the package to a destination on a root directory of
      your computer, such as =C:=, =D:= and so on as a destination.
   4. Within the folder =krp=, navigate to the =bin= folder found
      there and then click on the file "start-mandoku", which is a
      batchfile that sets up the environment and then starts
      Emacs. This file can also be accessed through a shortcut placed
      on the the Desktop, so you can easily find it next time. To make
      such a shortcut, right-click on the file "start-mandoku" and
      select "Send-to", then "Desktop (create shortcut)". You will
      then be able to use that shortcut to start Emacs (and Mandoku)
      next time.  Alternatively, you can also pin it to the taskbar
      for convenient access.
   5. When started for the first time, Emacs will install Mandoku and
      other packages that are required.  It will also try to install a
      workspace from your GitHub user account.  For best results, you
      should use this workspace and thus have your credentials for
      GitHub ready.  Emacs will ask you for your account name and the
      password. This will be used to ask the GitHub site to create a
      "token" for you. This token is stored and used for subsequent
      access from this machine; you will need the password only once
      and it will not be stored.  The startup process might take a
      while, but this is only necessary for the first time.

      

** Installing Mandoku on a Macintosh computer

   At the moment, there is no package for the Mac.  To install, use a
   recent version of Emacs (the version containing the patch by
   Yamamoto Mitsuharu of Chiba University, available at
   [[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport/releases][GitHub
   user railwaycat's account]], since this version supports the whole
   range of Unicode).

   Once you have Emacs installed, open it and find the "*scratch*"
   buffer.  This buffer might not be listed on the Buffer menu, but you can always
   find it in the Buffer list, which is available on the Buffer menu.  Once in the
   *scratch* buffer, paste the following code there:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(progn
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-refresh-contents)
(package-initialize)
(package-install 'mandoku)
)
#+END_EXAMPLE

      Then move the cursor to the very end of the buffer, in a
      position after the last closing ")" parenthesis and press the
      keys "C-x" and "C-e" (that is, press the control key and while
      keeping it pressed, also press the "x" key.  Then release both
      keys, press the control key again, followed by the "e").  This
      should get things going: Emacs will install Mandoku and other
      packages that are required.  

      To start using Mandoku for the first time, you will have to
      manually ask it to show the catalog.  This is done by typing
      "M-x" (M on the Mac is usually the command key, but in some
      configurations it could also be the "option" or "alt" key, just
      try to see which one works on your machine and then keep it
      pressed and also press "x").  Once you release the keys, you
      will see a prompt in the bottom most space of the Emacs window,
      this is called the minibuffer.  Now type "mandoku-show-catalog",
      and then the enter key.  This will initialize the mandoku
      package.  This process will make sure that next time the catalog
      will be loaded right away, so you need to do this only once.  
      
      Mandoku will now aks you where you want to put the files related
      to the use of the Kanseki Repository, that is mostly the texts,
      but also some other data files, the data you produce while you
      work with it, etc.  The program will suggest "~/krp" for you,
      which is the "krp" folder in your home directory.  You can
      either accept this by pressing enter, or enter a different path
      name followed by enter.  

      Mandoku will also try to install a workspace from your GitHub
      user account.  For best results, you should use this workspace
      and thus have your credentials for GitHub ready.  Emacs will ask
      you for your account name and the password. This will be used to
      ask the GitHub site to create a "token" for you. This token is
      stored and used for subsequent access from this machine; you
      will need the password only once and it will not be stored.  The
      startup process might take a while, but this is only necessary
      for the first time. If you do not want to mess around with
      accounts and passwords right now, you can also skip this step
      and use Mandoku right away.  Using your GitHub credentials will
      be necessary next when you want to download texts from the
      Kanseki Repository for local use.

      Once all is done, you should see a catalog file.  You can now
      continue below under "Using the preview version". 



** Installing =Mandoku= into existing Emacs installations

   =Mandoku= consists of a package with Emacs-lisp code.  The code
   itself is available in the melpa package. If you already have melpa
   in your list of package repositories, just go there and install the
   "mandoku" package.  Otherwise follow the instructions given for
   Macintosh users above.


* Using Mandoku

  At the moment, only a small fraction of the planned functionality
  has been realized.

  After starting Emacs with the =Mandoku= package installed,
  Emacs will display the file =mandoku-catalog.txt=, which is a list
  of titles available.  The file will look a bit different now, as the
  screenshot is from an earlier version.

  In some cases, the catalog file might be obscured by the Emacs
  splash screen. In such a case, the file can be brought to the front
  using the buffer menu as shown here:
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Emacs splash screen  :width 600
[[file:images/emacs-splash.png]]

  Another purpose of displaying the catalog list is the fact that this
  allows the menu for =Mandoku= to appear.  This menu is only
  available in =Mandoku= files (Emacs can display a large number of
  different file types, most of them are accompanied by corresponding
  menu entries).  =Mandoku= files are recognizable by the string
  "mandoku-view" in the lower part of the part of the screen that
  displays this file, in addition to that, they also show the title of
  the text and some more information about the text and the current
  location within the text.

  Here is the file =mandoku-catalog.txt= in the upper part and the
  catalog for the section 佛部 in the lower part:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Mandoku catalog file  :width 600
[[file:images/mandoku-catalog-txt.png]]


  The =Mandoku= menu has the following top level entries:
  - Display
  - Browse
  - Search
  - Maintenance

  Of these, we will first look at the "Search" menu, which has the following entries:
  - Texts       <f6>
  - Titles      <f7>
  - My files


  There are three different search actions, that is, within the texts,
  within the titles of the texts and within the dictionaries.  We will
  look at these in turns, but before that I want to mention that the
  mysterious "<f6>", "<f7>" and "<f5>" that appear on the menu are the
  keys that can be used to access this same functionality; usually it
  is much faster to use the keyboard.
  
** Text search
   At the moment, the text search function conducts a full-text search
   in the index, that has been generated for this purpose and displays
   the results as a keywoard in context (KWIC) list of matches. 

   When activating the menu or pressing the key F6, =Mandoku= will
   look at the characters immediately following the current position
   in the text displayed and offer them as default search key at the
   bottom of the =Emacs= application window. (This is called the
   minibuffer and serves a similar purpose dialog boxes have in other
   applications, that is, they are used for interaction with the user)

   =Mandoku= suggests six characters, but in most cases fewer
   characters are sufficient as search word.  However, at the moment
   =Mandoku= will refuse to display more than 2000 hits, so a search
   for just one or two characters will in many cases go over the
   limit, which then only displays a breakdown of the number of hits
   across the different parts of the collection, so it is recommended
   to use at least 3 characters for searching. If necessary, the
   suggested characters can of course be completely deleted and the
   desired search term given.

   If there are less than 2000 matches, a list of these matches is
   displayed. The display is in a very simple table, that gives the
   location of the match (usually the /juan/ number, page and line), a
   few characters left and right of the match and the text, where this
   match is found.  The text identification consists of the text
   number and the title of the text.  Both the location and the text
   title are active links.  Clicking on the location will open the
   text at the place where this passage is found and usually highlight
   the search term (this will not work always,
   unfortunately). Clicking on the text title will open the
   corresponding catalog file and display the entry for this text.

   The search result is a text file, similar to the format of the
   texts themselves.  It can be copied, saved and reopened or edited
   as needed. The order of the displayed items is according to the
   text following the term, which should put related passages in the
   vicinity of each other.  It is also possible to change the order of
   the displayed items, but that is an advanced topic that will be
   dicussed later.

   Text files are fetched for display from the remote server and
   cached locally in a temporary location.  At the moment, it is not
   yet possible to download full texts, access different editions of a
   text or look at the digital facsimile of a text, but all these are
   features to be implemented.

   Here is a selection of a index display for "修行人", which has 1095 matches in the text corpus:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Emacs index display  :width 500
[[file:images/mandoku-index-1.png]]

** Title search
   To locate a text and start reading it, title search is most
   convenient. Title search is activated with F7 or from the menu as
   shown.  Again it will display a prompt at the bottom of the screen
   and ask for the title to search for.  

   The result of the search will be displayed in a separate buffer in
   a table with several columns, displaying the "Bu" (Section), text
   number, text title, dynasty and author (or otherwise responsible
   person) for the text.  This information is taken from the catalog
   file, but pre-indexed for faster access.  Changes in the catalog
   file will require a re-indexing. 

   As usual, the cursor can be moved around to go to the desired row
   in the file. The original order is by title, but clicking on the
   top row, where the column names are displayed, will change the sort
   order according to the column, this allows for example texts from
   the same dynasty or the same author to be displayed closely
   together. On the row with the desired text, pressing "t" (text)
   will display the text, while pressing "i" (information) or "c"
   (catalog) will go to the catalog entry.

   Here is an example of the title display:
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Emacs title display  :width 500
[[file:images/mandoku-title-search-1.png]]

# ** Dictionary search

#    Dictionary search is initiated by pressing F5. If some text has
#    been selected, this selected text will be the search term.
#    Otherwise, the line of text that is currently displayed will be the
#    searched for.  For every string of one or more characters that has
#    an entry in at least one of the dictionaries, an item is generated
#    in the dictionary display.  In the dictionary display buffer, the
#    first line will display the text location, if one had been
#    identified, the following lines, beginning with two "**" characters
#    will contain the dictionary information.  Moving the cursor (or
#    "point") to the beginning of this line and then pressing the "tab"
#    key will open the display and reveal a list of the dictionaries
#    that contain this term. Pressing the "tab" key again will open all
#    dictionary entries at the same time. This might be a bit confusing,
#    in which case one can move the point to the beginning of the
#    desired line and press "tab" again. Some dictionaries have the full
#    text, others have only a reference to the page (and volume) where
#    the entry is found.  These are listed under the last entry "其他詞典".

#    Here is an example of a dictionary search, in this case for "周易", which will display three items:
# #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Emacs dictionary result display  :width 300
# [[file:images/mandoku-dict-1.png]]

#   Pressing tab on the start of the line displaying "** 周易" changes the display to:
# #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Emacs dictionary result display  :width 400
# [[file:images/mandoku-dict-2.png]]

#   And here is what is displayed under "其他詞典":
# #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Emacs dictionary result display  :width 400
# [[file:images/mandoku-dict-3.png]]
