# super-save

super-save auto-saves your buffers, when certain events happen - e.g. you switch between buffers,
an Emacs frame loses focus, etc. You can think of it as both something that augments and replaces
the standard `auto-save-mode`.

## Installation

Available on all major `package.el` community maintained repos -
[MELPA Stable][] and [MELPA][] repos.

MELPA Stable is recommended as it has the latest stable version.
MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
don't want to run from a git checkout.

You can install `super-save` using the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] super-save [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'super-save)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'super-save))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

## Usage

Add the following to your Emacs config to enable
`super-save`:

```el
(super-save-mode +1)
```

If you want to enable the additional feature of auto-saving buffers
when Emacs is idle, add the following as well:

```el
(setq super-save-auto-save-when-idle t)
```

At this point you can probably switch off the built-in
`auto-save-mode` (unless you really care about its backups):

```el
(setq auto-save-default nil)
```
