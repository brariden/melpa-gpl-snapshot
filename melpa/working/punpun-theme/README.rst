About
-----

Yowdy!  This theme is an experiment.  While there's plenty of
gorgeous-looking dark themes, I've had less luck with light themes, so
here's my own take on that.  There's a strong emphasis on shades of
gray, variations in font weight/slant and sometimes a bit of color.
For symmetry's sake a dark version is included.  As a bonus this theme
will work in 256-color terminal emulators as well.  Enjoy!

Installation
------------

Set up the `Marmalade <https://marmalade-repo.org/>`_ or `MELPA
(stable) <http://melpa.org/>`_ repository if you haven't already and
install with ``M-x package-install RET punpun-theme RET``.

Usage
-----

Either load the theme interactively with ``M-x load-theme RET
punpun-light RET`` or in your init file with:

.. code:: elisp

    (load-theme 'punpun-light t)

Replace ``punpun-light`` with ``punpun-dark`` for the dark version.
