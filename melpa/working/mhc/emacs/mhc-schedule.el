;;; Commentary:

;; This file is a part of MHC, and includes functions to manipulate
;; MHC-SCHEDULE structure.


;; About MHC-SCHEDULE structure:

;; Each MHC-SCHEDULE structure is a vector has a construction as
;; follows:
;;
;;     MHC-SCHEDULE ::= [ RECORD CONDITION SUBJECT LOCATION TIME ALARM CATEGORIES PRIORITY REGION RECURRENCE-TAG SEQUENCE]
;;     RECORD       ::= MHC-RECORD
;;     CONDITION    ::= MHC-LOGIC
;;     SUBJECT      ::= string ( represents subject of schedule )
;;     LOCATION     ::= string ( represents location of schedule )
;;     TIME         ::= integer ( represents minutes of day from midnight )
;;     ALARM        ::= string
;;     CATEGORIES   ::= CATEGORY*
;;     CATEGORY     ::= string ( represents category of schedule )
;;     PRIORITY     ::= integer
;;     REGION       ::= ( START . END )
;;     START        ::= integer ( represents start point of headers of schedule )
;;     END          ::= integer ( represents end point of headers of schedule )
;;     RECURRENCE-TAG ::= string
;;     SEQUENCE     ::= integer
