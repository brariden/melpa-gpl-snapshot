;;; Commentary:

;; This file is a part of MHC, and includes functions manipulate
;; MHC-RECORD structure.


;;; About MHC-RECORD structure:

;; Each MHC-RECORD structure is a cons cell has a construction as
;; follows:
;;
;;     MHC-RECORD ::= ( KEY . VALUE )
;;     KEY        ::= string ( represents file name of record )
;;     VALUE      ::= [ ID SCHEDULES SEXP ]
;;     ID         ::= string ( represents unique id of recort )
;;     SCHEDULES  ::= MHC-SCHEDULE*
;;     SEXP       ::= S expression to get schedule.
