;;; Commentary:

;; This file is a part of MHC, and includes functions to manipulate
;; MHC-DAY structure.


;;; About MHC-DAY structure:

;; Each MHC-DAY structure is a cons cell has a construction as
;; follows:
;;
;;     MHC-DAY      ::= ( KEY . VALUE )
;;     KEY          ::= DATE
;;     VALUE        ::= [ YEAR MONTH DAY-OF-MONTH DAY-OF-WEEK HOLIDAY SCHEDULES ]
;;     YEAR         ::= integer, larger than 1900.
;;     MONTH        ::= integer, between 1 and 12.
;;     DAY-OF-MONTH ::= integer, between 1 and 31.
;;     DAY-OF-WEEK  ::= integer, between 0 and 6.
;;     HOLIDAY      ::= nil or t.  t stands for holiday.
;;     SCHEDULES    ::= MHC-SCHEDULE*

;; Utility functions:

(defmacro mhc-day-let (day &rest form) "\
This special form converts DAY, as the number of days since
1970/01/01, to following local variables, and evaluates FORM.

     year
          The year, an integer typically greater than 1900.

     month
          The month of the year, as an integer between 1 and 12.

     day-of-month
          The day of the month, as an integer between 1 and 31.

     day-of-week
          The day of week, as an integer between 0 and 6, where 0
          stands for Sunday.
