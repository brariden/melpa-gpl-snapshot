* emacs-fasd

An Emacs extension to integrate [[https://github.com/clvv/fasd][Fasd]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Fasd (pronounced similar to "fast") is a command-line productivity booster. Fasd offers quick access to files and directories for POSIX shells. It is inspired by tools like autojump, z and v. Fasd keeps track of files and directories you have accessed, so that you can quickly reference them in the command line.

*** Prerequisites

- fasd

  https://github.com/clvv/fasd


*** Installation

**** quelpa

=quelpa= is at https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(fasd :repo "steckerhalter/emacs-fasd" :fetcher github))
#+END_SRC

Since the recipe is stored in melpa this also works:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa 'fasd)
#+END_SRC

Interactively: =M-x quelpa fasd RET=.

**** MELPA

You can install =fasd.el= using the packages on [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][Melpa]].

Make sure you have something like the following in your Emacs startup file (=~/.emacs.d/init.el=, or =~/.emacs=):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
#+END_SRC

To make that take effect, either evaluate that elisp expression or restart Emacs.

Then use M-x package-list-packages, select =fasd= from the list by pressing i, then press x to execute the changes. At that point, the package will be installed.

**** El-Get

Example recipe for el-get:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(:name fasd
       :type github
       :url "https://github.com/steckerhalter/emacs-fasd"
       :depends (grizzl)
       :postinit (progn
                   (global-set-key (kbd "C-h C-/") 'fasd-find-file)
                   (global-fasd-mode 1)))
#+END_SRC

*** Usage

Add a shortcut key for =fasd-find-file= and enable the =global-fasd-mode= which makes sure that opening files or directories in Emacs updates the fasd database.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-h C-/") 'fasd-find-file)
  (global-fasd-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Calling =fasd-find-file= with a prefix argument of

- =C-u= lists only directories
- =M--= lists only files

With no prefix it shows files and directories.

**** Options

Use the customize interface:

=M-x customize-group RET fasd RET=

***** Initial Prompt

Usually =fasd= will prompt for a initial query. To turn that off and get all results directly, set =fasd-enable-initial-prompt= to =nil=.

***** Completion Function

The default completion uses =grizzl=. If you want to use =ido=, =helm= or something else, customize =fasd-completing-read-function=.

***** Standard search

By default the =fasd= search parameter is =-a= which searches files and directories, you can customize this with the =fasd-standard-search= option.
