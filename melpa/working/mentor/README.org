* mentor

mentor is a GNU Emacs frontend for the [[http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/][rTorrent]] bittorrent client.  It uses
XML-RPC to communicate with rTorrent, and needs rTorrent to be configured
accordingly.

This project aims to provide a feature complete and highly customizable
interface, which will feel familiar to Emacs users. Key bindings are chosen to
be as close to the vanilla rTorrent curses interface as possible.

mentor still has some way to go before it can really be considered a complete
interface, so please moderate your expectations. It works fine for many common
tasks though, and in some cases (dare we say?) much better than the standard
ncurses interface.

** Installing mentor

*** Installing through MELPA (recommended)

If you are using Emacs 24 you can install mentor using ELPA.  It is available
from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]].  If you do not already have MELPA configured, add these lines to
your init.el:

: (add-to-list 'package-archives
:  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)

Evaluate these lines or restart Emacs. Next, find and install mentor using this
command:

: M-x package-list-packages

*** Installing mentor manually

If you for some reason do not use Emacs 24 (e.g. using Debian wheezy), or do not
want to use ELPA, you can install mentor manually.

Clone the repository using:

: git clone https://github.com/skangas/mentor.git

Add this to your init.el:

: (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/mentor/")
: (require 'mentor)

Change "~/src/mentor" to the path where you keep the mentor source code.

Make sure you have xml-rpc.el installed, at least version 1.6.9.

** Quick Start

- Add this to your init.el:

   : (require 'mentor)
   : (setq mentor-rtorrent-url "scgi://localhost:5000")

   Evaluate these lines or restart Emacs.

- Add this to your ~/.rtorrent.rc:
   
   : scgi_port = 127.0.0.1:5000
   : xmlrpc_dialect = i8
   : encoding_list = UTF-8
   
   Make sure `scgi_port' matches `mentor-rtorrent-url' above. Restart rTorrent.

- To start mentor, run:

   : M-x mentor

** Additional configuration

You can find Mentor in the `External' customize group.

 : M-x customize

** Configuring rtorrent

For more information on configuring rTorrent, refer to:

http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentXMLRPCGuide

** Known issues

- The file view needs much love, and is currently not known to be
  working. Sorry.

- There is no view for trackers/peers/extra information.

- There is currently no support (patches welcome) for communicating with
  rtorrent over a local socket using the more secure scgi_local command. This
  means it is currently not advisable to use mentor on anything but single
  user systems.

- mentor currently has some performance issues if you have many torrents
  (several hundreds). Be aware.


** Misc

- If you wish to byte-compile mentor, go into the source directory and run:

  : make

- Here is how you setup autoload. See the Emacs manual for more information on
  this.

  : (autoload 'mentor "mentor" nil t)
