* Purty Mode
  purty-mode.el --- Safely pretty-print greek letters, mathematical symbols, or anything else.

** Commentary
   purty-mode is a minor mode which swaps whatever-regexp-you-want for
   whatever-symbol-you-want on the fly.  Given that the text itself is
   left untouched, purty-mode can safely be used when writing code or
   latex or org or whatever.

** Setup
   Either install purty-mode from a package.el archive such as [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]],
   or place purty-mode.el somewhere on your load path, and
   add *(require 'purty-mode)* to your .emacs.

   *M-x purty-mode* invokes purdy-mode on the current buffer.

** Customization
   Substitutions can be added to purty via the purty-add-pair function.

   *(purty-add-pair '("Xi" . "Îž"))*


** Acknowledgements
   This source is essentially an extension of Mark Trigg's lambda-mode.el.
