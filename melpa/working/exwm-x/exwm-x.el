;; ** What is Exwm-X

;; Exwm-X is an extension of exwm (emacs x window manager), which can
;; make exwm easier for Mouse-Control-People to use.

;; ** Feature
;; 1. Shortcuts, toolbar and other window operate buttons in mode-line.
;; 2. Move or resize a floating-window without press WIN key.
;; 3. Jump-or-exec, which will switch to an exist app instead of launch it again.

;; ** Pictures and videos
;; 1. Tilling windows

;; 2. Floating windows

;; 3. Exwm-X videos
