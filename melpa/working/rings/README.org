* The only rings I care about are onion rings
  
  *M-x package-install rings*

  The problem with /C-x b/ is that most buffers don't matter and you
  need to spend some attention to filter them out.
  
  Keeping things in different tabs isn't also an ergonomic solution,
  because you'll need a different set of tabs for each activity you do
  inside Emacs, like editing code, editing server stuff, chatting on
  IRC, etc.
  
  I used to solve this problem by having different virtual desktops
  for different activities, but this doesn't work so smoothly on
  MacOS, so I created this package to provide a similar workflow.

* Suggested keybindings

  Here's what I have in my /init.el/:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<f2>")   (rings-generate-cycler 2))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<f2>") (rings-generate-setter 2))
(global-set-key (kbd "<f3>")   (rings-generate-cycler 3))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<f3>") (rings-generate-setter 3))
(global-set-key (kbd "<f4>")   (rings-generate-cycler 4))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<f4>") (rings-generate-setter 4))
#+END_SRC
  
* How does this work?
  
  Suppose you want to chat at Freenode's awesome /##latin/ channel and
  at the same time not be too far from the latin dictionary provided
  by [[http://github.com/konr/saaxy][SaaXy]]. With the keybindings above, you can add both buffers to a
  ring by pressing /C-<f2>/ inside each of them. Now, to cycle
  between them, just press /<F2>/
  
  More common is having to edit multiple objects, each of which has a
  model and a view. You could add Object A's buffers to a ring, Object
  B's to another ring, all views to a third ring and all models to a
  fourth. [[http://zombo.com/][Your imagination is the only limit]]!

  You can also ignore this ring thing and use the package just for
  bookmarks. This is useful when you are editing many files from a
  directory, and need a way to quickly return to it. I often use it
  with dired, adding a key directory to the <f4> ring, to make it
  available in a single keystroke.
