 2011-09-07  (cjwhite)
 - First release for general distribution based on API 2.0

 2011-09-18  (cjwhite)
 - (Bug fix) Properly create contexts that are missing on the
   server. (cjwhite)
 - (Bug fix) Eliminate hyphens in the tag/properties that are saved (cjwhite)
 - Implemented sub-tasks -- requires pro account subscription (cjwhite)
 - Added customization variable `org-toodledo-sync-import-new-tasks'

 2011-09-24  (cjwhite)
 - Use https if pro subscription and patch installed (url-http appears broken
   for POSTs with data and https, at least on my box).  To enable, apply the
   patch as follows:
       $ cd $emacs_install_dir/lisp/url
       $ patch < $path_to_patch/url-http.el.emacs-23.3.patch
   Then in emacs:
       M-x byte-compile-file $emacs_install_dir/lisp/url/url-http.el
   This patch seems to apply cleanly to 23.2 as well, but is not
   tested there.  Search below for "bugreport" for more details and
   bug references.

 - Added `org-toodledo-run-tests' to load and run tests in
   org-toodledo-test.el.  This uses the active account,
   creating/modifying/deleting tasks with the prefix
   'ORGTOODLEDOTEST'.  All other tasks are ignored, so it *should*
   operate cleanly on an active toodledo account with multiple
   tasks.  If you run this and it does not pass all tests, please
   let me know (cjwhite)

 2011-09-26  (cjwhite)
 - Bug fix for checking boundp (myuhe)
 - Support special chars (verified titles/notes) (myuhe)
 - Added `org-toodledo-inhibit-https' to disable https

 2011-09-29  (cjwhite)
 - Bug fix: marking a task completed on the server did not update locally

 2011-10-16  (cjwhite)
 - Bug fix: first time sync of tasks with folders failed with org-mode 6.33x

 2011-12-05  (cjwhite)
 - Bug fix: folder / id mapping was reversed
 - Bug fix: added require for aput / assoc
 - Properly clear fields that are not set locally, ensuring they get
   cleared on server

 2012-01-29  (cjwhite) - Version 2.2.0
 - Added support for starttime / duetime (merged in partical changes
   for myuhe).  Note that the web site does not seem properly handle
   timezones.  The time in org-mode is properly converted to a unix
   timestamp (adjusting for timezone) and sent to the server, but
   the displayed time on toodledo.com and in apps (at least iPad
   app) is the time component in GMT, not the timezone set in the
   account settings.  Waiting for a response from toodledo.com on
   this.

 - Added `org-toodledo-flatten-all-tasks' which disables
   parent/child tasking.  Set to true if you have more than 2 levels
   and wish to sync tasks to the server as a flat list at least for
   backup.

 - Improved debug logging, use `org-toodledo-toggle-debug' to turn
   on debug logging

 - Updated `org-toodledo-run-tests' to use a test account instead of
 the users account.

 2012-01-30  (cjwhite) - Version 2.3
 - Bug fix - major problem found whereby sync / modified times would
   be off just slightly when syncing local changes up to the server.
   This would make it look like the local task was still modified
   even after sending it up to the server.  As such, any changes to
   the task on the server would result in duplicate tasks in
   org-mode on the next sync, because that's how changes on both
   sides are handled.  As part of this fix I completely eliminated
   the per task Modified and Sync properities as these are pretty
   much unneeded because of the detection of changes by the hash
   code

 - Bug fix for startdate / duedate.  These were probably working ok,
   but may have misbehaved if the timezone were more than 12h off
   GMT, which I think can only happen in a very few rare cases.

 - Fixed up the starttime / duetime.  Turns out that toodledo.com
   treats these times like alarms, so a duetime of "7:00am" is 7am,
   regardless of what timezone you are in.  That means you can
   change your timezone at will and the duetime is still 7am *local*
   time.  This is stored as an offset from midnight GMT on the due
   date.

 - Added a version variable / function `org-toodledo-version'.  This
   is checked on sync and may do some cleanup of things that have
   changed in various versions.  This will make it easier down the
   road to detect what version someone is running as well.

 - Added some delays into the devtest -- seems it may have been
   syncing back and forth too fast (within the same second) such
   that changes may not be perceived

 - Added a lot more debug messages to help with timing / sync
   problems

 2012-02-09  (cjwhite) - Version 2.4
 - Added new patch for url-http.  This should address at least some
   of the spurious problems that caused an XML parse error.  If the
   XML response from the server was just around 1200 bytes, url-http
   was not handling it properly and cutting off the last few bytes.
   See the Installation instructions below for installing the
   patches

 2012-02-09  (cjwhite) - Version 2.5
 - Bug fix - requesting a token was still using https even if
   `org-toodledo-inhibit-https' was set to true.

 2012-02-19  (cjwhite) - Version 2.6
 - Added `org-toodledo-agenda-mark-task-deleted' function and
   suggested binding to mark tasks deleted from agenda mode.  See
   Installation for info

 - When a task is marked for deleted, move the task to a task titled
   "Deleted Tasks" to get it out of the way

 - Handle more than 2-levels of hierarchy by flatting all children.
   The hierarchy will be preserved.  See SUBTASKS above for more
   details.

 - Realign all tags after sync according to the width of the current window

 - Better handling of 'duplicate' tasks -- When a task has been
   modified locally and on the server, the user is prompted to
   resolve the difference by selecting the local copy, the server
   copy, or editing and resolving manually

 2012-02-19  (cjwhite) - Version 2.6.1
 - Fix for use of http vs https

 2012-02-20  (cjwhite) - Version 2.7
 - Added support for tags, they are added as org-mode tags.

 - Fixed handling of tasks with an embedded '*' - this would
   completely mess things up of the '*' was the first char of
   a line

 - Added customization `org-toodledo-indent-task-note', set to t
   by default.  This indents the note according to the task level.
   This has a cleaner look and reduces the chance of errors like
   the above with '*' as the first char.

 - Better detection of actual note text, eliminating blank lines

 - Fixed handling of "Invalid Key" error that indicates the token
   needs to be refreshed

 - Fix bug for subtasks if parent is not at top-level

 2012-03-13  (cjwhite) - Version 2.8
 - Significantly better error handling for adding, editng and deleting
   tasks during synchronization.  If errors occurred, only the offending
   task should be affected, allowing all other tasks to be synced.  The
   specific error message is logged for better debugging.

 - Added customization `org-toodledo-folder-support-mode'.  Setting this
   to `heading' will create heading tasks according to the folder name
   and put all tasks in that folder as child tasks of the heading.
   No support yet for creating folders in org mode, create the folders
   on toodledo.com first and put at least one task in the folder.  This
   feature is somewhat experimental.

 - Improved handling of token expiration / invalid key errors

 - Added simulation mode for testing without actually hitting the server.
   Allows simulating error conditions that are potentially hard to
   reproduce with a real connection to the server.  See org-toodledo-sim.el
   and org-toodledo-test.el where sim calls are used.

 2012-07-21  (cjwhite) - Version 2.9
 - Added 'length' to the list of fields to ignore if 0 for computing
   a hash

 - Removed deprecated/obsolete use of aput/adelete from assoc.el

 - Hopefully finally fixed spurious issue where syncing resulted in
   "Failed to find todo entry...".  When processing incoming tasks
   from the server, process parent tasks *then* child tasks.  It seems
   in some cases the child task may show up first before the parent
   is known.

 2013-03-24  (cjwhite) - Version 2.10
 - Renamed folder/goal properties to ToodledoFolder and ToodledoGoal

 - Added `org-toodledo-reset' function to eliminate any trace of
   toodledo from an org file (great to use if you want to refresh
   the server from your master org file)

 - Fixed a bug where parent/child tasks may not sync properly.

 - Improved folder support, works well now supporting creating folders
   and moving tasks around to folders, including subtasks.

 - Fixed a bug that was causing issues running tests

 2013-06-08  (cjwhite) - Version 2.11
 - Fixed github issue #15, org-sync failed with org 8.x due to
   missing function

 2013-08-20  (cjwhite) - Version 2.12
 - Revamp how deleted tasks are handled, just store the deleted
   task ids instead of the "Deleted Tasks" folder


 - Support for `org-toodledo-archive-deleted-tasks'.  When non-nil
   deleted tasks are automatically archived after synced to the
   the server.  This is related to github issue #17.

 - Fixed github issue #21, error adding context that already exists.
   The issue occurred because org is case sensitive, whereas toodledo
   is not.  Fixed by ignoring case when looking for contexts and folders.

 - Fixed github issue #22, toodledo does not support empty tasks.  Added
   a check to skip over any such tasks

 2013-09-01  (cjwhite) - Version 2.13
 - Support for `org-toodledo-archive-completed-tasks'.  When non-nil
   completed tasks are archived.  This supports archiving tasks completed
   locally via org as well as syncing-in tasks that were completed on
   Toodledo.

 2013-09-02  (cjwhite) - Version 2.14
 - Fixed issue #24 - pay attention to org-default-priority

 2013-09-28  (cjwhite) - Version 2.15
 - Fixed issue #26 - look at `org-toodledo-sync-new-completed-tasks'
   when syncing for the first time.  If t, sync all completed tasks

 - Fixed issue #27 - support priority -1 as org levels E-Z

 - Fixed issue #28 - drop extra space in dates when no repeat

 - Fixed issue #31 - cleaned up compiler warnings

 - Fixed issue #29 - added `org-toodledo-post-sync-hook' to call after
   each synchronization, even if errors occurred.

 2013-11-30  (jeffkowalski) - Version 2.16
 - Whitespace cleanup

 - Support for 'org-toodledo-preserve-drawers'.  When non-nil drawer
   properties will be preserved in entry text.  As a consequence of this
   modification, incoming entry text will have properties pulled out.

 - Set Repeat even if only the SCHEDULED/start repeats, and the DEADLINE
   does not.

  2014-03-30  (cjwhite) - Version 2.16
 - Fixed problem with "Effort" showing up in drawers when not expected
