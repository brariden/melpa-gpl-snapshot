* 4clojure.el
  Open and evaluate [[http://www.4clojure.com/][4clojure]] questions.
** Install
   Use =M-x package-install RET 4clojure= to install. Make sure you have
   the [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]] package archive enabled in your init.el or .emacs and your package
   contents are up to date (use =M-x package-refresh-contents= if you can't
   find the 4clojure package and you've added MELPA to your package archives.
** Usage
   1. To open a specific problem:
    =M-x 4clojure-open-question RET 2= opens question 2.
   2. To check your answers:
    =M-x 4clojure-check-answers=
   3. To open the next question (opens the first if you're not in a 4clojure buffer):
    =M-x 4clojure-next-question=
   4. To open the previous question (opens the first if you're not in a 4clojure buffer):
    =M-x 4clojure-previous-question=
** Tips and Tricks
*** Start a cider/nREPL connection when you open a question
    If you want to try out your solutions before you submit them, you can run
    them from emacs with cider. Make sure you have cider installed (=M-x
    package-install cider=) and add the following to your .emacs or init.el:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'cider)

(defadvice 4clojure-open-question (around 4clojure-open-question-around)
  "Start a cider/nREPL connection if one hasn't already been started when
opening 4clojure questions"
  ad-do-it
  (unless cider-current-clojure-buffer
    (cider-jack-in)))
#+END_SRC
** Helping out
   If you want to help out, great! This is my first emacs plugin, so help is
   much appreciated. Open an issue or check out the [[https://github.com/joshuarh/4clojure.el/issues][existing issues list]] for
   some ideas on what might need updating/fixing.
