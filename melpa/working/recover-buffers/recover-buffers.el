;;; recover-buffers.el --- revisit all buffers from an auto-save file
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is a replacement for `recover-session` which actually recovers
;; your state from the previous Emacs session -- revisits all files and
;; allows you to continue where you left off.
;;
;; For more details, please see the GitHub README.md presentation at
