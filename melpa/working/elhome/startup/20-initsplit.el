;; often untested, and only discovered at customization time.
;; Although the file can usually be fixed by adding a simple `(require
;; 'xxx)', the following usually avoids the error in the first place.  Note,
;; however, that if xxx-settings uses symbols from elsewhere,
;; e.g. xxx-yyy, it will still need to load or require that library.
