    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Log4j mode</i> is a major mode for viewing log files in Emacs. It can
      be used to view any text based log file, even though the name refers to a
      specific logging package. Log4j mode provides syntax highlighting,
      filtering, and source code browsing.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many applications that can be used to view log files, but using
      Log4j mode allows you to do it without leaving Emacs. It also provides
      good integration with the source code.
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
      The major features of Log4j mode are described below.
      See <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> for examples of how this
      looks in GNU Emacs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Syntax highlighting</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Log4j mode uses customizable regexps with keywords such as DEBUG and
      ERROR to syntax highlight log records. Different faces are used for
      different log levels. The user can customize both the regexps, and the
      faces that are used for syntax highlighting.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Filtering</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Log4j mode can filter a log file buffer using keywords specified by the
      user, creating a new buffer that contains only matching log records. When
      the source buffer is auto reverted, the filter buffer will be updated
      too.
    </p>

    <p>
      To filter a log file buffer, type C-c C-s, and enter the desired filter
      criteria - any number of keywords separated by spaces. Log records that
      contain any of the words in the include list, and none of the words in
      the exclude list, will be copied to the filter buffer. All other log
      records will be discarded. To stop filtering the log file buffer, just
      type C-c C-s again.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Source code browsing</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Source code browsing is provided using
      <a href="http://jtags.sourceforge.net"><i>jtags</i></a> - an Emacs
      package for editing and browsing Java source code. It is possible to jump
      from a log file to a point in the source code where a certain log record
      was generated.
    </p>

    <p>
      To show the source code for a Java identifier found in the log file,
      place the point in the identifier, and type C-c C-b. Log4j mode will
      parse the expression around point, and look up the Java identifier found
      using package jtags. If you are not using jtags, or if you are not
      developing in Java, you can still use the built-in tags lookup feature.
      Type M-. to run the find-tag command in the <i>etags</i> package.
    </p>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      The latest version of Log4j mode has been tested in GNU Emacs 23.1 and
      GNU Emacs 24.5 running on Windows 7.
    </p>
