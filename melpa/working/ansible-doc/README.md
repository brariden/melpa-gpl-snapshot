Usage
-----

In a YAML Mode buffer, press <kbd>C-c ?</kbd> (`ansible-doc`) to view the
documentation of an Ansible Module.  The command prompts for the name of a
module, defaulting to the module at point if any.

The first invocation of `ansible-doc` may take some time, because the command
assembles a list of all Ansible modules for completion.
