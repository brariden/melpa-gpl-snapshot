;;; Commentary:

;; These are some little utilities using chee from Emacs. It should
;; also support editing chee matadata rec file.

;; The function `chee-minor-display-image-at-point' displays the image
;; if point is on a file checksum (part of).

;; When editing the metadata file it can be used to display the image
;; represented by the current record. The `chee-minor-rec-setup'
;; function sets up some key bindings for rec-mode:

;; - 'v' to `chee-minor-display-image-at-point'
;; - 'V' to toggle a minor mode that displays the image after
;;       navigating to a record.
