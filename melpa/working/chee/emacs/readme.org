#+title: Chee for Emacs

This is an Emacs interface to the chee cli program. It uses [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html#Dired][dired]] and
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Image_002dDired.html#Image_002dDired][image-dired]].

It provides a special buffer where you can edit chee queries. Then
chee is called in a subprocess and the results are added to a dired
buffer and a thumbnail buffer.

* Installation

You must install the chee cli program first. Please refer to the
readme in the root folder.

If chee is installed, use the following lines in Emacs to load the
interface:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/chee/emacs")
(require 'chee)
(chee-setup-default)
#+end_src

It also is on melpa, so you can install from there, too:
~(package-install 'chee)~

The entry point function is ~chee-query-open~ which opens a buffer
where you can edit the arguments to chee (i.e. the query). From this
buffer, run the query with ~C-c C-c~. The function
~chee-setup-default~ does a very simple setup: it puts this function
under key ~C-c C-s~ in the ~global-map~.


* Usage

#+name: Example
[[file:example.gif]]

Run ~chee-query-open~ and write a query. Run the query using ~C-c
C-c~. Additional options can be toggled or set via the printed key
strokes. Results are added to a dired buffer and an image-dired
buffer. Paging is enabled in those buffers using ~M-n~ and ~M-p~,
respectively. Use the great image-dired from there.

Setting a ~File~ makes chee search this directory instead of the
index. This can be unset with a prefix argument. Setting a
~Repository~ makes chee execute in this repository directory. Again,
this can be unset using a prefix argument.
