By default, all encrypted files are skipped. With `-d` those files are
tried to decrypt. The _Decryption options_ can be used to specify how
to decrypt. Since there are two encryption methods, it is possible to
use both or just one. If there are only options for one method given,
the other is not used (meaning these encrypted files are skipped).
