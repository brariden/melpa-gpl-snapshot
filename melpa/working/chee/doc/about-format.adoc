=== Format Patterns

Format patterns are a flexible way to print property maps. A format
pattern is a string with literal text and directives. A directive
specfies how to print a certain value from the property map.

Format patterns are used by a few commands (i.e. the `find` command)
to generate human readable output for a property map.

A directive always starts with a tilde `~` character followed by more
characters that control its behaviour. There are basic directives that
print a value of a property map and there are directives that change
the output of other directives. This makes creating output very flexible.

Since a directive starts with `~`, to really print a `~` it must be
doubled, like `~~`.


==== Value Directive

The `~#` directive returns the value of a property. For example, the
following prints the value of the `filename` property:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~#filename
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a property map, it would look up the value for `filename` and
interpolate it into the string.

As in queries, the identifiers can be abbreviated to the shortest
non-ambiguous term.


==== Formatting Values

Another directive can be appended to the `~#` directive, to further
format the value. For example, the `width` property has a numeric
value and could be printed with padded 0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~#width~f%08d
----------------------------------------------------------------------

would print `00002048` for a width of `2048`. The special format
string _%08d_ is a printf-style format string.

This is more useful for date/time values that should be printed using
a custom pattern. For example

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~#created~fyyyy
----------------------------------------------------------------------

would only print the year of the created property in 4 digits. A
description of possible date patterns can be found
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#patterns[here].


==== Readable Directive

To print the file size, the `~#length` directive would print the
number of bytes of the file. But this is usually not a very user
friendly value. And others, like date and times are similiar.

That is why the `~:` directive exists. It can be used to print more
user friendly output: dates/times are printed in a specific pattern
and the `length` value is converted to a string like “7.1mb”. Likewise
the `pixel` property is printed in abbreviated form: instead of
`4100000` it prints `4mp`.


==== Newline Directive

The directive `~%` prints a newline character. This is useful to
generate multi line output.


==== Fixed Width

The `~xy` directive, where `x` is a number and `y` is either `l` or
`r` (for “left” and “right”) wraps another directive and cuts or pads
its output such that it is exactly `x` characters long. If `l` is
specified, shorter strings are padded with spaces on the left. If `r`
is specified, spaces are appended to shorter strings to yield the
requested size.

If the string is too long it is cut at some point and characters are
removed until the required length is reached. The point where deletion
started is marked with an ellipsis `…` character.

For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
>~20l~#filename\<
----------------------------------------------------------------------

would print for the value “test.jpg”

----------------------------------------------------------------------
>            test.jpg\<
----------------------------------------------------------------------

and for a value “/home/pictures/2014/winter/test.jpg”

----------------------------------------------------------------------
>/home/pi…er/test.jpg\<
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The `>` and `\<` are not part of the directive; it is normal literal
text.


==== Max Length Directive

This directive is similiar to the fixed width directive, but will only
cut strings longer than the specified length. It is written `xmy`
where `x` is the maximum length and `y` is either `l` for cut from
left or `r` for cut from right.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~8mr~:checksum
----------------------------------------------------------------------

would print the first 8 characters of the checksum

----------------------------------------------------------------------
a90545b8
----------------------------------------------------------------------


==== Sequence Directive

The `~{` directive can be used to group more directives into one. It
must be closed by a matching `~}`.

This is useful, if you want to apply a modifying directive like the
fixed-width directive to multiple directives.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~20l~{~:width x ~:height~}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies the fixed-width directive to the concatenation of the
string inside `~{` and `~}`.


==== Conditional Directive

There is a directive that can be used to print something if a value
exists for a property and a different thing in case it does not
exist. The directive looks like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~[\<condition>~;\<ifTrue>~;\<ifFalse>~]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three directives inside `~[` and `~]` that are separated by
a `~;`.

The `condition` directive is a property name. In case there is a value
for this property, the `ifTrue` directive is used, otherwise the
`ifFalse` directive.

.Example
----------------------------------------------------------------------
~[model~;~:model~;no model~]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This would print the camera model if it exists and otherwise the
literal text `no model`.


==== Loop Directive

If you want to print all properties, the `~@` directive can be
used. It must be followed by a sequence directive is evaluated for
every known property identifier.

Inside the sequence directive, there are two more property values
available: `ident` and `value` refering to the current property
identifier and associated value.

For example, this print all properties in a comma separated line:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~@~{~#value,~}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It results in something like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
,2012-11-26 13:50:19,jpg,CIMG2590_s.JPG,1536,100,2015-12-21T21:33:04Z,48746,/workspace/projects/chee2,CASIO COMPUTER CO.,LTD,image/jpeg,EX-Z750,top, left side (horizontal / normal),/images/CIMG2590_s.JPG,2048,95254d11a2916bff2357ea3f1572d366398de17150b8ef11d5f11ef8061f371b,
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It would be nicer, if the last comma is not printed. For this the
_stop directive_ `~^` can be used:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~@~{~#value~^,~}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It tells the loop directive, that everything following it should only
be printed if the loop is not finished. If it is on the last element,
everything after the stop directive is ignored. The stop directive
itself prints nothing.

The loop directive skips virtual properties. To include them, a `*`
can be added:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~@*~{~#value~^,~}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

With the newline directive, it is easy to print every property on its
own line. And a fixed-width directive can provide a nicely formatted
output:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~@~{~20r~{~#ident:~} ~:value~^~%~}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This prints all properties:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The variant `~@!` of the loop directive will skip non-existing
properties. The body of the loop is only evaluated for existing
properties.

[NOTE]
======================================================================
Within the loop directive, the `value` identifier can only be used
with the _ValueDirective_ or _ReadableDirective_. When using the
_ValueDirective_ it is not possible to use the `~f` format pattern.
======================================================================

==== Quote Directive

The loop directive is intended to print output that is parsed by other
programs. It is often required to put strings in quotes to protect
whitespace (in filenames for example). But numeric values don't need
to be quoted (often it is more convenient, if not).

The quote directive `~"` or `~'` wraps the output of the following
directive in double and single quotation, respectively, if it is not
numeric. Numeric values are not wrapped.

For example, this can be used to format properties in a CSV style:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
~@~{~"~#value~^,~}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Prints

----------------------------------------------------------------------
"","2012-11-26 13:50:19","jpg","CIMG2590_s.JPG",1536,100,"2015-12-21T21:33:04Z",48746,"/workspace/projects/chee2","CASIO COMPUTER CO.,LTD","image/jpeg","EX-Z750","top, left side (horizontal / normal)","/images/CIMG2590_s.JPG",2048,"95254d11a2916bff2357ea3f1572d366398de17150b8ef11d5f11ef8061f371b"
----------------------------------------------------------------------


==== Empty Directive

Since the value directive ends in an identifier, it is not possible to
write literal text immediately following it, because it would be
interpreted as part of the identifier. In order to do this, use the
_empty directive_ `~.`. It prints nothing and can be used to separate
identifiers from literal text.

.Example
----------------------------------------------------------------------
~:width~.x~:height
----------------------------------------------------------------------

would print

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2048x1536
----------------------------------------------------------------------


==== Predifined Formats

These directives allow for very flexible output control. If patterns
get too complex, they can be stored in the configuration file and
referred to by name. Chee also provides a few patterns for some common
uses:

- `oneline` prints one line with columns of some of the properties
- `lisp` prints a property list of all properties as a lisp data
  structure
- `detail` prints all properties, each on one line
- `paths` prints only the absolute filenames separated by newline

If you want to add your own bookmarks, add them in the configuration
file to the key `chee.formats`. For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
chee {
  formats {
    mycsv : "~@~{~\"~:value~^,~}~%"
  }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, whenever there is a pattern to be specified, you can use the
name `mycsv` to refer to this pattern.
