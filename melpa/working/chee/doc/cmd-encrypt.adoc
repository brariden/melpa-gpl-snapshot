This example encrypts all photos created in march 2016 using public
key encryption.

The _Find options_ are for selecting source images to encrypt. These
are the same as with the `find` command.

The files are encrypted using http://openpgp.org[OpenPGP] and there
are two possible ways:

- using a public key, so decryption requires the corresponding private
  key
- using a password, where the same is used for decryption

The `--method` option chooses one of the two. Its value can also be
specified in the config file and the default value is `pubkey`.

For `pubkey` encryption, a `--key-file` and `--key-id` must be
specified. The key file must be in OpenPGP format. The key id can be
the email address or a finger print (suffix). It must identify the
public key in the key file.

For `password` encryption, the passphrase can be typed in or read from
a file.  A default password can be set in the configuration file which
is used if no `--passhprase` is given, unless `-W` is specified that
will always prompt for a passphrase.

Please see the xref:_configuration[configuration] chapter for related
configuration values and the page about xref:_encryption[encryption].
