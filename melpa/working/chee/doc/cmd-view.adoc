=== view

View the images with an external image viewer.

The view command is just like `find`, but instead of listing it runs
an external program to view the resulting files.

The query definition is the same as with the `find` command. So both
commands can be used interchangeably.

The image viewer program is defined in the config file under the key
`chee.programs.viewer`. It should be the program name followed by some
options. The files are appended to the arguments arguments. By default
the http://feh.finalrewind.org/[feh] image viewer is used and started
with `feh -.` to enable auto resizing.
