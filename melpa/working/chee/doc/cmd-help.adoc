Some manual pages describe the basic concepts of chee. They can be
opened using `--about`. Help pages about specific commands open with
the `--command` switch. By default (if no switch is present) command
pages are requested.

The `--html` can be used to request html pages that are opened in a
browser. By default, the text version is printed to stdout.

The name `manual` is special, it will always start a browser with the
complete manual (all pages combined in one html). There is no text
version.
