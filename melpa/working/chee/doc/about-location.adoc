=== Locations

Locations are directories with images that chee queries by
default.

Chee can be used to query images anywhere in the file system. But
since most of the time photos are stored at the same places, chee can
manage such places–called “locations”. By default, commands operating
on a set of files search all known locations. Results can be
restricted to specific locations with a query.

Images from other directories can be “imported“ into a location. Chee
simply copies the files and skips any duplicate by default.
