A simple Emacs interface for Spotify that makes good use of helm.

* Video

See how [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjKtkEMUYGc&feature=youtu.be][the first version was coded in 16 minutes]].

** Installation

If you're hooked up to [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET helm-spotify
#+END_EXAMPLE

Alternatively just grab the single =helm-spotify.el= file and
install that in your preferred way.

* Usage

=M-x helm-spotify= and type a search string.

(The search begins after you've typed at least 2 characters. You can
use space-separated terms for psuedo-fuzzy matching.)

*** Keys

| =C-n=   | Next item.                       |
| =C-p=   | Previous item.                   |
| =RET=   | Play this track.                 |
| =C-z=   | Play this album.                 |
| =TAB=   | More options.                    |
| =C-h m= | Full list of keyboard shortcuts. |

* Status

Ready to use.

Currently OSX & Linux only. Windows support is available, but
partial. Please contribute the code for your platform, if you can!

* Supporting Other Platforms

Find out what emacs says your =system-type= is. (=C-h v system-type=).
Let's say it shows the symbol =ms-dos=. Then you need to write this function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defmulti-method spotify-play-href 'ms-dos
    (href)
    ...
    ... href is a string that's something like "spotify:track:5Yt80fWRB8JG73XlPjrrKP"
    ...
    ... here, you write any code that will cause Spotify to play that href.
    ...
    )
#+END_SRC

Then submit a pull request!
