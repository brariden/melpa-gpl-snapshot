* bbdb2erc.el
Makes *BBDB* show if a pal is online with *ERC*, lets you click =i= to
chat.

Usage: put =(require 'bbdb2erc)= in your =~/.emacs=

When the *BBDB* window pops up, the minibuffer should tell you if the
person is online (otherwise it's silent). You can make it tell you
again by pressing =I= in the bbdb window. You specify the nick(s) of
the person in the `irc-nick' field in BBDB, as in the erc-bbdb.el
package.

This package also overrides the default binding of =i= in *BBDB* to
start an ERC chat with the record at point. You can read the *BBDB*
info manual by typing =M-x bbdb-info instead=, or return to the
default binding with =(define-key bbdb-mode-map (kbd "i")
'bbdb-info)=.

If you use Gnus, you might also want to go straight from a
summary/article to a chat with the sender, put this in your =~/.emacs=
to achieve that: =(define-key gnus-summary-mode-map (kbd "i")
'bbdb2erc-pm)=.

Requires BBDB version 3 (but see
https://github.com/unhammer/bbdb2erc/tree/bbdb2 if you're still using
BBDB version 2).

Note: you should probably also install the package =erc-bbdb.el=, part
of the =erc-5.3-extras= package, not in standard GNU Emacs. It should
be available from http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/erc/ if it's not in your
distro's package manager. Read more about it at
