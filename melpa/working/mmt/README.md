The package contains classic tools for Emacs Lisp developers who want to
write macros with convenience.

The following functions and macros are present:

* `mmt-gensym`
* `mmt-make-gensym-list`
* `mmt-with-gensyms`
* `mmt-with-unique-names`
* `mmt-once-only`

## Installation

Put it on your `load-path` and then add the following at the top of file
where you would like to use the goodies:

```emacs-lisp
(require 'mmt)
```

That's it. Don't forget to include it in your list of dependencies if you
are writing an Emacs Lisp package:

```emacs-lisp
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.1") (mmt "0.1.1"))
```

The library is available on MELPA and MELPA stable.

## API

```
mmt-gensym &optional x
```

Create and return new uninterned symbol as if by calling `make-symbol`.

The only difference between `mmt-gensym` and `make-symbol` is in how the new
symbol's name is determined. The name is concatenation of a prefix which
defaults to `"G"` and a suffix which is decimal representation of a number
that defaults to the value of `mmt--gensym-counter`.

If `x` is supplied and is a string, then that string is used as a prefix
instead of `"G"` for this call to `mmt-gensym` only.

If `x` is supplied and is an integer, then that integer is used instead of
the value of `mmt--gensym-counter` as the suffix for this call of
`mmt-gensym` only.

If and only if no explicit suffix is supplied `mmt--gensym-counter` is
incremented after it is used.

----

```
mmt-make-gensym-list length &optional x
```

Return a list of `length` gensyms.

Each element of the list is generated as if with a call to `mmt-gensym`
using the second argument `x` (defaulting `"G"`).

----

```
mmt-with-gensyms names &rest body
```

Bind each variable in `names` to a unique symbol and evaluate `body`.

Each of `names` must be either a symbol, or of the form:

```
(symbol string-or-symbol)
```

Bare symbols appearing in `names` are equivalent to:

```
(symbol symbol)
```

The `string-or-symbol` is used (converted to string if necessary) as the
argument to `mmt-gensym` when constructing the unique symbol the named
variable will be bound to.

----

```
mmt-with-unique-names names &rest body
```

This is an alias for `mmt-with-gensyms`.

----

```
mmt-once-only specs &rest body
```

Rebind symbols according to `specs` and evaluate `body`.

Each of `specs` must be either a symbol naming the variable to be rebound or
of the form:

```
(symbol initform)
```

where `initform` is guaranteed to be evaluated only once.

Bare symbols in `specs` are equivalent to

```
(symbol symbol)
```

Example:

```emacs-lisp
(defmacro cons1 (x)
  (mmt-once-only (x) `(cons ,x ,x)))

(let ((y 0))
  (cons1 (incf y))) ;; ⇒ (1 . 1)
```
