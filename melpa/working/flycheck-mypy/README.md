[![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/flycheck-mypy-badge.svg)](http://melpa.org/#/flycheck-mypy)

Since version [3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/), Python supports typing hints.
[MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) makes use of those hints to type-check your code.

This package is a FlyCheck interface to MyPy.
