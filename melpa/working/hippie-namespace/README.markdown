## Quickstart

```elisp
(require 'hippie-namespace)
 
(global-hippie-namespace-mode 1)
 
(define-key global-map (kbd "M-/") 'hippie-expand)
 
;; type hi [M-/]     ; The first one or two letters of a namespace
                     ; found in the current buffer, followed by the
                     ; key bound to `hippie-expand'.
```

## Explanation

The purpose of hippie-namespace is to save typing.

Enabling this minor mode adds a limited number of very common
prefixes to the `hippie-expand` expansion list.  These prefixes
(deduced from buffer content) will be the first completions
considered.

Furthermore, hippie-namespace completions are treated specially:
when `hippie-expand` proposes a namespace completion, it will not
cycle.  Instead, the namespace completion is implicitly accepted,
and further invocations of `hippie-expand` will build on the
expansion.

For example, the common prefix of all symbols in this library is
"hippie-namespace-".  If, while editing this library, the user
types "hi [hippie-expand]" or even just "h [hippie-expand]",
the full prefix is expanded.

"hi [hippie-expand] [hippie-expand] ..." will then cycle through
all completions which match the prefix.

This mode makes more sense for some languages and less sense for
others.  In most languages, the declared "namespace" is
infrequently used in its own context.  (For Emacs Lisp that is
not the case.)

Note that you should also have `hippie-expand` bound to a key.
Many people override dabbrev expansion:

```elisp
(define-key global-map (kbd "M-/") 'hippie-expand)
```

## Determining Namespaces

The minor mode will examine each buffer to guess namespace prefixes
dynamically.  If the guess is not good enough, you may add to the
list by executing

<kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>hippie-namespace-add</kbd>

or by adding a file-local variable at the end of your file:

```elisp
;; Local Variables:
;; hippie-namespace-local-list: (namespace-1 namespace-2)
;; End:
```

Mode-specific namespace finders are easy to write.  Search for "Howto"
in the source.

## Notes

Integrates with [expand-region](http://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el), adding an expansion which is aware of the
namespace and non-namespace portions of a symbol.

## Bugs

Breaks using <kbd>C-u</kbd> [hippie-expand] to undo. Workaround: use
regular undo commands.
