# Welcome to voca-builder

voca-builder is an Emacs package that was developed to help you build
up your vocabulary. It automates most of the steps in the lookup and
recording processes, and therefore improve your efficiency and
productivity. By using it, you could

1.  see the meaning of vocabulary immediately on your screen with a
    single keystroke,
2.  spent more time in actually learning and memorising new
    words, and leave the manual organising tasks to voca-builder.
3.  extract vocabularies by the tags you create or vocabularies recored
    in a period for an intensive revision,
4.  import/export vocabularies from/to various flashcard platform,
5.  focus on your reading with minimal distribution without switching
    app to check dictionary.

If you are Emacs user and trying to build up your vocabulary, you
definitely should give it a try.
