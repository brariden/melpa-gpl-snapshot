# ember-mode #

Ember-mode speeds up navigation in EmberJS projects.

## Usage ##

Ember-mode helps in jumping and generating javascript files in an emberjs project.  It assumes an ember-cli-like folder-structure and supports both coffeescript and javascript extensions.  Experimental support for POD structures has recently been added.

### example usage ###

`ember-mode` can be used to either generate, destroy, or navigate between files.

#### example setting ####

Let's assume you have the following files in your emberjs folder structure:


    - app
      router.coffee
        - models
            - friend.coffee
            - plugin.coffee
        - controllers
            - plugins.coffee
        - routes
            - friends.coffee
            - plugins.coffee
            - friends
                - show.coffee

#### navigation ####

Say you are visiting the `models/friend.coffee` file with `ember-mode` enabled.  Pressing `C-c . f r` will move to `routes/friends.coffee`.

If, from there on, you enter `C-c . f c` ember-mode will try to open `controllers/friends.coffee`.  As that doesn't exist, it'll try all of the following:

    - controllers/friends.js
    - controllers/friend.coffee
    - controllers/friend.js

As none of these exist, it lists all controllers and lets you select one of them.


#### manual generation ####

Say we are visiting `routes/plugins.coffee` and would like to generate a `Peer` model.  Pressing `C-c . g m` will ask for the name of the class to generate (with a default of `plugins`) and the options to be passed to the generator.  The default is hinted based on the current file.

Similarly, if we are visiting `routes/plugins.coffee` and want to generate a controller, pressing `C-c . g c` will ask for the name of the controller to generate (with a default of `plugins`) and the options to be passed to the generator.  In essence, pressing enter twice will generate `controllers/plugins.coffee`.


#### automatic generation ####

Say we are visiting `models/friend.coffee` and want to generate the `friend` route.  Pressing `C-u C-c . g r` will use the ember generators to generate the route and open it (without posing any questions).

Note that pressing `C-c . f r` would have navigated to `routes/friends.coffee` and wouldn't have found the newly generated route before.


*PRO TIP:* If you are using coffeescript, enable `ember-cli-coffeescript` to generate coffeescript instead of javascript files.  If you don't, javascript files will be generated.

    cd path/to/your/ember-cli-project
    npm install ember-cli-coffeescript --save-dev

### building, serving, testing ###

`ember build` and `ember test` can be run with `C-c . r b` and `C-c . r t`
respectively, and `C-c . r s` will either run `ember serve`, or bring up
the serve buffer if already running. These commands use compilation
mode to link errors to files with line and column numbers. If the
buffer that `ember serve` runs in is buried, it will also notify of
build status via minibuffer messages.


### working with PODs ###

Ember-mode is shipped with basic support for the POD structure.  Navigation support and generators operate the same, but keep the POD structure in mind.

Ember-mode will pick up `"usePods": true` when set in `.ember-cli`.  If this is set, navigation occurs assuming a POD structure.  See the installation section for more information on overriding the detection of a POD enabled project.

    C-c . r b       ember-build
    C-c . r s       ember-serve-or-display
    C-c . r t       ember-test

If you wish to use a different prefix other than `C-c .`, you may
customize the variable `ember-keymap-prefix` with `M-x
customize-variable`.


## Installation ##

- clone this folder in your emacs.d folder:

        mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/
        cd ~/.emacs.d
        git clone https://github.com/madnificent/ember-mode.git


- add the folder to your load path in your `~/.emacs` file if it isn't there already and require ember-mode.

        (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/ember-mode/")
        (require 'ember-mode)

    
- reload the settings, go to an ember project, enable ember-mode and try out your new keybindings!

        M-x ember-mode

- to enable ember-mode in specific projects, create a `.dir-locals.el`
  file in your ember project with the following:

        ((nil . ((mode . ember))))
  
  In order to override pod structure detection, you can use the ember-use-pods variable:
  
        ((nil . ((mode . ember)
                 (ember-use-pods . t))))

- alternatively, to enable ember-mode for all javascript and handlebar
  files, assuming you use javascript-mode and web-mode, you would put
  this in your init file:

        (add-hook 'js-mode-hook (lambda () (ember-mode t)))
        (add-hook 'web-mode-hook (lambda () (ember-mode t)))
