This package adds support for status icons to Emacs.

It does so via a helper program written in Python.  You'll need
Python and the (new-style) Gtk bindings installed for it to work.

The base "status" lisp code doesn't have any user-visible features.
It just adds infrastructure that's usable from elisp.

This package includes code to hook ERC and EMMS up to status icons.
