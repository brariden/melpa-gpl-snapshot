Labburn is a port of the [Zenburn for Emacs theme](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs), which in turn is
is a direct port of the popular [Zenburn](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/) theme for vim,
developed by [Jani Nurminen](https://github.com/jnurmine).

The main change is the movement of color defintions to the [Lab Color Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space),
which allows better manipulation and comparative equality in perception of the lightness of different colors. Colors were converted from the zenburn theme and slightly adjusted in lightness.
All/most bold attributes were removed as well, as these change the lightness perception. Developtment of the original zenburn theme is tracked as far as appropiate, last _merged_ commit was _3112683_.

The theme is made to be used with the rainbow-identifiers package, please enable this.
