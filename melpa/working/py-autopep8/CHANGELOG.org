* CHANGELOG

** 0.8
- Avoid altering the killring.

** 0.7
- Try to avoid =^M= by using the current buffer's coding system.
- Deprecated =py-autopep8()=.
  Use =py-autopep8-buffer()= instead.
- Before save hook is set locally:
  Replace =(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'py-autopep8-before-save)= with =(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'py-autopep8-enable-on-save)=.
  This will break your config.

** 0.6

** 0.4
- Replaced incf and decf.

** 0.3
- Added check if =autopep8= executable is present.

** 0.2
- Added options to change =autopep8='s behaviour.

** 0.1
- Renamed functions: This will break your code.
