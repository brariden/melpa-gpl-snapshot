;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs-IDE (eide) is a package for Emacs that provides IDE features
;; (Integrated Development Environment).

;; Although most of these features are already available in Emacs,
;; the purpose of this package is to integrate them into a user-friendly
;; interface, with dedicated windows (source files, menu, and ouput),
;; convenient keyboard shortcuts, and project management.

;; It is suitable for almost all languages (as long as they are supported by
;; Ctags). Cscope provides additional browsing facility for C/C++ files.
