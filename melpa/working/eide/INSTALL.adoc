= Instructions for installing Emacs-IDE

You just have to create the package and install it.

[source,sh]
----
$ ./build-package
$ ./install-package
----

The package is installed in ~/.emacs.d/elpa/eide-<version> directory.

You must add the following lines in your ~/.emacs:

[source,lisp]
----
(package-initialize)
(eide-start)
----

NB:

* (package-initialize) might already be present and should not be added in that
  case.
* If you have installed several versions, the package with the higher version
  number will be loaded.
* If you're installing a development version, the package version number is not
  relevant.
