* erc-hl-nicks - ERC Module to Highlight Nicknames

** I already have a nickname highlighter, why should I switch?
If you're happy with what you're using, you shouldn't.  (If it ain't
broke...)  BUT, if you are interested in trying something new, here
are some things you should know:
- erc-hl-nicks is based on erc-highlight-nicknames, so it will auto
  colorize nicknames (you don't have to specify colors)
- erc-hl-nicks will ignore certain characters that IRC clients add to
  nicknames to avoid duplicates (nickname, nickname', nickname'',
  etc.)
- erc-hl-nicks can attempt to produce colors with a sufficient amount
  of contrast between the nick color and the background color.

** Installation
*** Via Package (recommended)
Pick your favorite package archive- I do try to keep this package
up-to-date on Marmalade and it is also available via Mepla and
Melpa-stable.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

;; Either of these will work, as well.

;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)

;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

(package-initialize)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then you can install it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET erc-hl-nicks RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Manually (via git)
Download the source or clone the repo and add the following 
to ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/erc-hl-nicks")
(require 'erc-hl-nicks)
#+END_EXAMPLE
