# flymake-google-cpplint.el

If you're want to write code according to the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml), this will help a great deal.

I recommend that the package [google-c-style](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/google-c-style) also installed with.

To use [cpplint.py](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpplint/cpplint.py) with Emacs, you will need `cpplint.py` installed.

You should be able to run

```sh
$ cpplint.py
```

and, you'll also need to install [flymake-easy](https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy).

$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/cpplint.py
```

## Add to load-path

```

## Add to your Emacs config
