* Items left to do as of 09/06/2015
** TODO Make undo work properly
*** Goals
**** All cursors should return to their original positions after an undo/redo
**** Cursors should not affect the overall undo steps
- except all commands at cursor should be lumped in one
  undo step with the original command
**** Undo/Redo should still work properly after the cursors are deactivated
*** Progress
**** Make each undo step contain the original command and the fake commands
**** Keep track of cursor positions for each undo/redo step
**** Move the cursors to their positions during an undo command
- undo
- redo
- undo-tree-undo
- undo-tree-redo
**** Whitespace cleanup could interfere with the cursor positions if at eol
**** Fix undo for evil-repeat 
- maybe this should be part of completing the evil-repeat implementation
*** Implementation
**** Track undo data per cursor
***** position : the cursor position when an undo step starts
***** undo-stack : previous positions per undo step
**** Command recording should add the following info
***** new-step-p : this is command is a new undo step
***** undoable-p : this is an undo-able command
***** complete-undo-step-p : this command is a complete undo step
***** undo-p : this is an undo/redo command
- one of undo, redo, undo-tree-undo, undo-tree-redo
**** When running a command for all cursors
***** remove the nil marker if any
***** remove any nil markers in between the fake commands
***** re-add the nil marker after the fake commands have run if any was removed
**** During an undo command
***** move cursors to their previous positions (saved in undo-stack)
***** what happens during a redo?
** TODO Make evil-repeat work for all commands
** TODO Fix move-text-up/down
*** Currently it only works only for non-consecutive lines
** TODO Maybe have a default for unknown commands
*** Default could be evil-mc-execute-macro but need to initialize the correct evil state
*** This would allow supporting unnamed commands
** TODO Make change line (cc) work properly
*** Currently it works if the cursors are on non-consecutive lines or if the real cursor is positioned before the fake cursors
*** The work around is ^C but that doesn't work with a count
** TODO Add tests
