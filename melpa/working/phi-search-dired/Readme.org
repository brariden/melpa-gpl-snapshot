** Usage

Install phi-search and phi-search-dired.el (put into load-path), and
require this script

: (require 'phi-search-dired)

then command "M-x phi-search-dired" is available in dired buffers. You
may also bind a key to the command.

: (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "/") 'phi-search-dired)

In the phi-search window, following commands are available in addition
to the normal phi-search keybinds.

- [SPC] phi-search-dired-restrict-to-matches

  Hide all unmached items.

- [DEL] phi-search-dired-backspace-or-undo

  If there's a character before the point, delete it. Otherwise undo
  restriction (show hidden items again).

If you quit phi-search window with [RET], then all matching items are
marked. To quit without doing anything more than filtering, quit with
[C-g].
