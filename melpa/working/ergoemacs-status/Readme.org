#+TITLE: ergoemacs-status
This is a modernized mode-line (outside emacs this is called a status
bar). This status bar changes its contents based on window size:

#+ATTR_HTML: title="screenshot "
[[./img/small-status.png]]

With a large window, a large amount of information is displayed:

#+ATTR_HTML: title="screenshot"
[[./img/large-status.png]]

* Getting It
** Requirements
   | package    | version  |
   |------------+----------|
   | emacs      | >= 23    |
   | [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]]  | >= 2.3   |
   | [[https://github.com/ryuslash/mode-icons][mode-icons]] | >= 0.10  |


** Starting status-bar
To use  library in your load path and use

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (require 'ergoemacs-status)
 (ergoemacs-status-mode)    
#+END_SRC
* Features
The main features include:
- Iconic display of text properties
- Easy to Hide or highlight minor modes
- Very easy to configure

* Customizing status-bar
** Changing what elements are displayed
You can change what elements are displayed by right-clicking on a
blank area in the status bar. This brings up a list of information that is displayed on the status-bar:

[[./img/status-popup.png]]

You can select or deselect what is shown in the menu-bar.

This configuration is saved for the next emacs session.

** Changing the order of the status bar elements
You can change the display order of any element by Alt+clicking and
then dragging the element around.

The element you select will be displayed and changed as you move your mouse.

For example Alt+clicking on the linux icon, highlights the encoding
section of the mode-line or status bar:

[[./img/status-select.png]]

By dragging, you can then move the element:

[[./img/status-select-move.png]]

This configuration is saved for the next emacs session.

** Hiding/displaying minor-modes

By default, the ergoemacs-status hides minor modes based on the size
of your window.  However, you can permanently hide by clicking on the
mode. In minor modes without specific menus, the hide button will be in
the center:

[[./img/hide-1.png]]

If the minor mode has it's own menus, like =flycheck-mode=, the hide
button will be on the bottom of the menus:

[[./img/hide-2.png]]

If you change your mind and want to show the minor mode, you can click
on the up-arrow, then the hidden minor mode and, and then "Show this
minor mode":

[[./img/show.png]]

This configuration in saved for the next emacs session.

You can also suppress a mode from being in the hidden modes popup or
in the status-bar / mode-line: This is done by adding the mode symbol
to the variable =ergoemacs-status--suppressed-minor-modes=.  For
example, to hide =flyspell-mode=, you can add the following

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (push 'flyspell-mode ergoemacs-status--suppressed-minor-modes)
#+END_SRC

after loading =ergoemacs-status=.  This is saved in your
initialization settings like =~/.emacs=

By default =isearch-mode= is suppressed in =ergoemacs-status=.
