About
=====

Edit with Emacs is an extension for Google's Chrome(ium) browser family
that allows you to edit text areas on your browser in a more full
featured editor. It does this in conjunction with an "Edit Server"
which services requests by the browser. This is because extensions
cannot spawn new processes as a security measure.

The extension packages native elisp version that can be run inside
GNU Emacs itself, just follow the instructions from the options page
of the extension. It has been known to work with GNU Emacs and
Aquamacs (MacOS); it is presently not compatible with XEmacs.

Other example edit servers can be found at the project homepage. There
is no reason why other server scripts could not spawn other editors
and currently a number of servers support the simple URL based
protocol.

This extension is licensed under the GPL v3 and development versions
can be found at: http://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome

Installing
==========

If you just want to install Edit with Emacs you can simply visit the
Chrome Store at:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edit-with-emacs/ljobjlafonikaiipfkggjbhkghgicgoh

You then have the option of installing the packaged edit-server from the
options page or alternatively you can install the latest version from
MELPA if you have it enabled in Emacs 24+.

If you would like to help with the development of Edit with Emacs the
easiest way is to fork the github repository (https://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome)
and clone it to your development system. The in Chrome(ium) go to:

Tools->Extensions
Select "Developer Mode"
Click "Load Unpacked Extension"

and point it at the cloned repository.

Hacking
=======

This modeline should be used in every source file to keep indentation
consistent:

    // -*- tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; c-basic-offset: 4 -*-

This tells both emacs use spaces instead of tabs and use a basic indentation
of 4 spaces.

There is currently a minimal Travis-CI control file which
essentially ensures the edit-server.el still compiles. Additions to
the test coverage are always welcome ;-)

History
=======

Dave Hilley [1] wrote the original proof of concept that showed it
could be done. I [2] then hacked around with the Javascript to make
the behaviour more like the classic It's All Text add-on available to
Firefox.

Other Code
==========

This extensions takes advantage of the jQuery library
to do a lot of the heavy lifting in searching the page
for elements. You can find it at:

http://jquery.com/

It uses John Resig's jQuery Colour Animation plug-in
to do the colour fades of the elements. It can be found
at:

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color

The settings code uses Frank Kohlhepp's excellent
fancy-settings library. This can be found at:

https://github.com/frankkohlhepp/fancy-settings

The textarea code uses the rather nifty mutation summary
library by Google. This can be found at:
