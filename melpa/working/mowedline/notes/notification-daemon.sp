  notification-daemon is something that listens to a well defined dbus
`handle' and displays notifications on the screen as they arrive.  there
are at least 3 independent implementations of ND.  libnotify is a library
for sending notifications to said handle.

  the statbar could possibly implement notification-daemon.
