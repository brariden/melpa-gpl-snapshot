# vala-snippets
Yasnippet to use with Vala

Info
====

Made this since there really isn't anything for Vala. I'm also new to Vala
so I made snippets that I though would be handy for me and other people. Of course
I could be missing some vital snippets that you might think are handy, go ahead an contribute :)

Install
========

Package is available in [MELPA](http://melpa.org/#/vala-snippets)

To add Melpa just follow their [instructions](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa#usage)

Once that is finished just type:
~~~
M-x package-install vala-snippets
~~~

Contributions
=============

To add snippets just fork repo, add file snippet and submit PR.
