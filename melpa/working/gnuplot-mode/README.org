#+TITLE gnuplot-mode

* Introduction
  Gnuplot is an extremely useful program -- it's fast, easy to use and great
  for getting a look at your data before starting a more sophisticated
  analysis.  You can run gnuplot interactively at a command prompt, but I
  generally find it easier to write a plot script instead.

  In order to edit these scripts a little more comfortably, I wrote
  this major mode for emacs.  It offers syntax hilighting and basic
  indentation, as well as a command to plot the file.  You can run the
  plot command either directly (by =M-x gnuplot-run-buffer=), or with
  the (customizable) shortcut =C-c C-c=.

  Here is a screenshot showing the basic syntax hilighting.  Note that it
  warns you about spaces at the ends of lines, which cause gnuplot to crash,
  but are otherwise hard to spot.

  #+ATTR_HTML: alt="syntax-hilighting" title="syntax-hilighting" width="586" height="531"
  [[file:images/gnuplot-syntax-hilight.png]]

  The mode runs gnuplot entirely in the background.  If gnuplot reports an
  error, it creates a buffer called "*gnuplot errors*" and brings it to the
  front to show you what happened.

  #+ATTR_HTML: alt="error" title="error" width="586" height="531"
  [[file:images/gnuplot-errors.png]]

  This uses the emacs =compile= system, so commands like =next-error=
  and =previous-error= will work as expected.

  You can also send commands to gnuplot using =C-c C-b= (send buffer
  to gnuplot) or =C-c C-r= (send region to gnuplot), but the error
  reporting isn't as helpful with these functions.

  This mode was inspired by the one written by Bruce Ravel (available [[http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/gnuplot-mode.html][here]]),
  but I think it's much simpler to use -- it runs gnuplot non-interactively,
  and only has one command to remember.

* Installation
  If you like, you can download the file [[https://github.com/mkmcc/gnuplot-mode][here]].  Once this file is somewhere
  visible to emacs, you can add the following to your =.emacs= to make it
  work.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; make sure file is visible to emacs (if needed)
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/your/lisp/files")
    
    ;; load the file
    (require 'gnuplot-mode)
    
    ;; specify the gnuplot executable (if other than /usr/bin/gnuplot)
    (setq gnuplot-program "/sw/bin/gnuplot")
    
    ;; automatically open files ending with .gp or .gnuplot in gnuplot mode
    (setq auto-mode-alist 
    (append '(("\\.\\(gp\\|gnuplot\\)$" . gnuplot-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
  #+END_SRC

  Better yet, use MELPA!  If you add MELPA to your package archives
  using the following, you can install gnuplot mode with a simple =M-x
  package-install gnuplot-mode=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  #+END_SRC

  I hope you find this useful.  Please let me know if you encounter any
  problems with the mode, or if you have any suggestions for improving it.
