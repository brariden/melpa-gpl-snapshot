;;; Commentary:

;; Google+ does not have any markup for program code, which is highly
;; annoying. This simple command will add some markup to share code
;; more easily on Google+, based on fontification.

;; Sadly, it will break if the code itself includes Google+ markup. As
;; there is no escape mechanism included in Google+, there's not much
;; we can do there.

;;; Code:

(defvar gplusify-face-highlights
  '((font-lock-keyword-face "*")
    (font-lock-function-name-face "_"))
  "Alist mapping face names to Google Plus characters.")
