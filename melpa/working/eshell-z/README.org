** Introduction
The =eshell-z= package is an Emacs port of [[https://github.com/rupa/z][z]].
It keeps track of where youâ€™ve been and how many commands you invoke there,
and provides a convenient way to jump to the directories you actually
use. =eshell-z= and =z= can work together by sharing the same data file.

** Install
*** MELPA
After setting up [[http://melpa.org][MELPA]] as a repository, use =M-x package-install eshell-z= or
your preferred method.

*** Manually
Add eshell-z to your =load-path=. Something like

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/eshell-z")
#+END_SRC

** Setup
To use this package, add following code to your init.el or .emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'eshell-z)
#+END_SRC

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC
~ $ z -h
usage: z [-chlrtx] [regex1 regex2 ... regexn]

    -c, --current        estrict matches to subdirectories of the current directory
    -h, --help           show a brief help message
    -l, --list           list only
    -r, --rank           match by rank only
    -t, --time           match by recent access only
    -x, --delete         remove the current directory from the datafile

examples:

    z foo         cd to most frecent dir matching foo
    z foo bar     cd to most frecent dir matching foo, then bar
    z -r foo      cd to highest ranked dir matching foo
    z -t foo      cd to most recently accessed dir matching foo
    z -l foo      list all dirs matching foo (by frecency)
#+END_SRC

** Notations

*NOTICE* _This section is copied from the manpage of [[https://github.com/rupa/z][z]]._

*** Aging
The rank of directories maintained by z undergoes aging based on a simple
formula. The rank of each entry is incremented every time it is accessed.  When
the sum of ranks is over 9000, all ranks are multiplied by 0.99. Entries with a
rank lower than 1 are forgotten.

*** Frecency
Frecency is a portmanteau of 'recent' and 'frequency'. It is a weighted rank
that depends on how often and how recently something occurred. As far as I know,
Mozilla came up with the term.

To z, a directory that has low ranking but has been accessed recently will
quickly  have  higher rank than a directory accessed frequently a long time
ago.

Frecency is determined at runtime.

*** Common
When multiple directories match all queries, and they all have a common prefix,
z will cd to the shortest matching directory, without regard to priority.  This
has been in effect, if  undocumented, for quite some time, but should probably
be configurable or reconsidered.

** Tab Completion
z supports basic tab completion, press TAB to complete on options and
directories. This is implemented with =pcomplete=.
