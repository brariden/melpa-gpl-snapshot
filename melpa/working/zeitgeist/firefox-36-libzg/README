Unknown symbols in ubuntu lucid
===============================

On ubuntu lucid `ldd -r *.so` shows libxpcom as unknown symbol, to fix this create 

	/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libxpcom.conf

with this content: 

	# for xpcom
	/usr/lib/xulrunner-1.9.2.3


And rebuild the cache
	$ sudo ldconfig

You have to do the same for libzeitgeist!

==============

the uuid for the component is
	d879c08c-517d-44f0-83e1-3ef75a527ddf
