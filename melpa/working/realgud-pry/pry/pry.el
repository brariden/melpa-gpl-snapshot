  "Invoke the pry debugger and start the Emacs user interface.

OPT-CMD-LINE is treated like a shell string; arguments are
tokenized by `split-string-and-unquote'.

Normally, command buffers are reused when the same debugger is
reinvoked inside a command buffer with a similar command. If we
discover that the buffer has prior command-buffer information and
NO-RESET is nil, then that information which may point into other
buffers and source buffers which may contain marks and fringe or
marginal icons is reset. See `loc-changes-clear-buffer' to clear
fringe and marginal icons.
