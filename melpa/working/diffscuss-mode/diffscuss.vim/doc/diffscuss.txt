1. ABOUT                                              *diffscuss-about*

Diffscuss.vim is a Vim plugin for working with Diffscuss files. It offers
syntax highlighting, comment insertion, commands for jumping to source files,
motions for comments and threads, and easy access to the Diffscuss mailbox
scripts from within Vim.

===========================================================================
2. CONFIGURATION                                      *diffscuss-config*

The Vim plugin will use its environment and 'git config' to determine your name
and email (for pre-filling comments) and for various runtime paths.

If you wish, you can override these settings by specifying some or all of a
`g:diffscuss_config` dictionary in your `.vimrc`: >

    let g:diffscuss_config = {
        \'author': 'Your Name',
        \'email': 'your.email@example.com',
        \'diffscuss_dir': '/path/to/diffscuss',
        \'python': '/path/to/python'
        \}
