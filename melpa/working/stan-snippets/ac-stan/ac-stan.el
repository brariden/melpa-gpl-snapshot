;;; Commentary:

;; Auto-complete mode support for `stan-mode'.  This mode uses `imenu-mode',
;; snippets from `stan-yasnippet', and a dictionary to generate completion
;; candidates.
;; 

;;; Code:
(require 'auto-complete)
(require 'stan-mode)
(require 'yasnippet)
(require 'stan-snippets)

(add-to-list 'ac-dictionary-directories
	     (expand-file-name "ac-dict"
			       (file-name-directory
				(or load-file-name (buffer-file-name)))))

(defun stan-ac-mode-setup ()
  "Setup `auto-complete' mode for `stan-mode'."
  (auto-complete-mode t)
  (yas-minor-mode-on)
  (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-imenu
		     ac-source-yasnippet
		     ac-source-dictionary)))

(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'stan-mode)

(provide 'ac-stan)
