This is not literally the Stan Language definition, which is in the [Stan Modeling Language User's Guide and Reference Manual](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/).
This repo contains `stan-lang.json`, which contains various keywords and built-in functions in Stan that I use in maintaining several editor modes and syntax highlighting defintions.
In particular, this is used to generate the keyword and function lists in:

- Emacs [stan-mode](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan-mode).
- Atom [language-stan](https://github.com/jrnold/atom-language-stan).
- [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) StanLexer.
- LaTeX package [lstbayes](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lstbayes) ([github](https://github.com/jrnold/lstbayes)).
