Why the name change?
====================
:author: Phillip Lord

This package used to be called "clojure-owl", but has since been renamed to
"tawny-owl". I was never really happy with the former; I think it is a bad
idea to have the name of the language in the title of a library (as the
hundreds of jLibraries demonstrates). It was just the best that I could come
up with when I started this library.

There are also a couple of other Clojure libraries dealing with OWL. This one
has a very particular purpose: it is not designed for operating on OWL, it is
designed to be an ontology builders tool. I want a specific name, which is
discrete, memorable and which is somewhat separated from the function; in
short, something which is
[semantics-free](http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/2040).
