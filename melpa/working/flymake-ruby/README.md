flymake-ruby.el
===============

An Emacs flymake handler for syntax-checking Ruby source code.

Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient packages in
[Melpa][melpa] and [Marmalade][marmalade], you'll need to add the
directory containing `flymake-ruby.el` to your `load-path`, and then
`(require 'flymake-ruby)`. You'll also need to install
[flymake-easy](https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy).

Usage
=====

Add the following to your emacs init file:

    (require 'flymake-ruby)
    (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'flymake-ruby-load)
