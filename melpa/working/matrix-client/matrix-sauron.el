;;; Commentary:

;; This library pushes Matrix events in to Sauron, allowing you to easily see a
;; list of notifications and jump to them. See https://github.com/djcb/sauron
;; for information about Sauron.

;; To use this, install Sauron via package.el or manually, and then load or eval
;; this library. Add 'sauron-matrix to sauron-modules and run [`sauron-start']
