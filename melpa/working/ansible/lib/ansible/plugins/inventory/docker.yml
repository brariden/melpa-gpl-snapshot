# This is the configuration file for the Ansible plugin for Docker inventory.
#
# Author: Paul Durivage <paul.durivage@gmail.com>
#
# Description:
# This module queries local or remote Docker daemons and generates
# inventory information.
#
# This plugin does not support targeting of specific hosts using the --host
# flag. Instead, it it queries the Docker API for each container, running
# or not, and returns this data all once.
#
# The plugin returns the following custom attributes on Docker containers:
#    docker_args
#    docker_config
#    docker_created
#    docker_driver
#    docker_exec_driver
#    docker_host_config
#    docker_hostname_path
#    docker_hosts_path
#    docker_id
#    docker_image
#    docker_name
#    docker_network_settings
#    docker_path
#    docker_resolv_conf_path
#    docker_state
#    docker_volumes
#    docker_volumes_rw
#
# Requirements:
# The docker-py module: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-py
#
# Notes:
# A config file can be used to configure this inventory module, and there
# are several environment variables that can be set to modify the behavior
# of the plugin at runtime:
#    DOCKER_CONFIG_FILE
#    DOCKER_HOST
#    DOCKER_VERSION
#    DOCKER_TIMEOUT
#    DOCKER_PRIVATE_SSH_PORT
#    DOCKER_DEFAULT_IP
#
# Environment Variables:
# environment variable: DOCKER_CONFIG_FILE
#     description:
#         - A path to a Docker inventory hosts/defaults file in YAML format
#         - A sample file has been provided, colocated with the inventory
#           file called 'docker.yml'
#     required: false
#     default: Uses docker.docker.Client constructor defaults
# environment variable: DOCKER_HOST
#     description:
#         - The socket on which to connect to a Docker daemon API
#     required: false
#     default: Uses docker.docker.Client constructor defaults
# environment variable: DOCKER_VERSION
#     description:
#         - Version of the Docker API to use
#     default: Uses docker.docker.Client constructor defaults
#     required: false
# environment variable: DOCKER_TIMEOUT
#     description:
#         - Timeout in seconds for connections to Docker daemon API
#     default: Uses docker.docker.Client constructor defaults
#     required: false
# environment variable: DOCKER_PRIVATE_SSH_PORT
#     description:
#         - The private port (container port) on which SSH is listening
#           for connections
#     default: 22
#     required: false
# environment variable: DOCKER_DEFAULT_IP
#     description:
#         - This environment variable overrides the container SSH connection
#           IP address (aka, 'ansible_ssh_host')
#
#           This option allows one to override the ansible_ssh_host whenever
#           Docker has exercised its default behavior of binding private ports
#           to all interfaces of the Docker host.  This behavior, when dealing
#           with remote Docker hosts, does not allow Ansible to determine
#           a proper host IP address on which to connect via SSH to containers.
#           By default, this inventory module assumes all 0.0.0.0-exposed
#           ports to be bound to localhost:<port>.  To override this
#           behavior, for example, to bind a container's SSH port to the public
#           interface of its host, one must manually set this IP.
#
#           It is preferable to begin to launch Docker containers with
#           ports exposed on publicly accessible IP addresses, particularly
#           if the containers are to be targeted by Ansible for remote
#           configuration, not accessible via localhost SSH connections.
#
#           Docker containers can be explicitly exposed on IP addresses by
#           a) starting the daemon with the --ip argument
#           b) running containers with the -P/--publish ip::containerPort
#              argument
#     default: 127.0.0.1 if port exposed on 0.0.0.0 by Docker
#     required: false
#
# Examples:
#  Use the config file:
#  DOCKER_CONFIG_FILE=./docker.yml docker.py --list
#
#  Connect to docker instance on localhost port 4243
#  DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:4243 docker.py --list
#
#  Any container's ssh port exposed on 0.0.0.0 will mapped to
#  another IP address (where Ansible will attempt to connect via SSH)
#  DOCKER_DEFAULT_IP=1.2.3.4 docker.py --list
#
#
#
# The Docker inventory plugin provides several environment variables that
# may be overridden here.  This configuration file always takes precedence
# over environment variables.
#
# Variable precedence is: hosts > defaults > environment
