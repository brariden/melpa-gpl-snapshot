Ansible Changes By Release
==========================

## 1.8.1 "You Really Got Me" - Nov 26, 2014

* Various bug fixes in postgresql and mysql modules.
* Fixed a bug related to lookup plugins used within roles not finding files based on the relative paths to the roles files/ directory.
* Fixed a bug related to vars specified in plays being templated too early, resulting in incorrect variable interpolation.
* Fixed a bug related to git submodules in bare repos.

## 1.8 "You Really Got Me" - Nov 25, 2014

Major changes:

* fact caching support, pluggable, initially supports Redis (DOCS pending)
* 'serial' size in a rolling update can be specified as a percentage
* added new Jinja2 filters, 'min' and 'max' that take lists
* new 'ansible_version' variable available contains a dictionary of version info
* For ec2 dynamic inventory, ec2.ini can has various new configuration options
* 'ansible vault view filename.yml' opens filename.yml decrypted in a pager.
* no_log parameter now surpressess data from callbacks/output as well as syslog
* ansible-galaxy install -f requirements.yml allows advanced options and installs from non-galaxy SCM sources and tarballs.
* command_warnings feature will warn about when usage of the shell/command module can be simplified to use core modules - this can be enabled in ansible.cfg
* new omit value can be used to leave off a parameter when not set, like so module_name: a=1 b={{ c | default(omit) }}, would not pass value for b (not even an empty value) if c was not set.
* developers: 'baby JSON' in module responses, originally intended for writing modules in bash, is removed as a feature to simplify logic, script module remains available for running bash scripts.
* async jobs started in "fire & forget" mode can now be checked on at a later time.
* added ability to subcategorize modules for docs.ansible.com
* added ability for shipped modules to have aliases with symlinks
* added ability to deprecate older modules by starting with "_" and including "deprecated: message why" in module docs

New Modules:

* cloud: rax_cdb - manages Rackspace Cloud Database instances
* cloud: rax_cdb_database - manages Rackspace Cloud Databases
* cloud: rax_cdb_user - manages Rackspace Cloud Database users
* monitoring: zabbix_maintaince - handles outage windows with Zabbix
* monitoring: bigpanda - support for bigpanda
* net_infrastructure: a10_server - manages server objects on A10 devices
* net_infrastructure: a10_service_group - manages service group objects on A10 devices
* net_infrastructure: a10_virtual_server - manages virtual server objects on A10 devices
* system: getent - read getent databases

Some other notable changes:

* added the ability to set "instance filters" in the ec2.ini to limit results from the inventory plugin.
* upgrades for various variable precedence items and parsing related items
* added a new "follow" parameter to the file and copy modules, which allows actions to be taken on the target of a symlink rather than the symlink itself.
* if a module should ever traceback, it will return a standard error, catchable by ignore_errors, versus an 'unreachable'
* ec2_lc: added support for multiple new parameters like kernel_id, ramdisk_id and ebs_optimized.
* ec2_elb_lb: added support for the connection_draining_timeout and cross_az_load_balancing options.
* support for symbolic representations (ie. u+rw) for file permission modes (file/copy/template modules etc.).
* docker: Added support for specifying the net type of the container.
* docker: support for specifying read-only volumes.
* docker: support for specifying the API version to use for the remote connection.
* openstack modules: various improvements
* irc: ssl support for the notification module
* npm: fix flags passed to package installation
* windows: improved error handling
* setup: additional facts on System Z
* apt_repository: certificate validation can be disabled if requested
* pagerduty module: misc improvements
* ec2_lc: public_ip boolean configurable in launch configurations
* ec2_asg: fixes related to proper termination of an autoscaling group

* various parser improvements
* produce a friendly error message if the SSH key is too permissive
* ec2_ami_search: support for SSD and IOPS provisioned EBS images
* can set ansible_sudo_exe as an inventory variable which allows specifying
  a different sudo (or equivalent) command
* git module: Submodule handling has changed.  Previously if you used the
  ``recursive`` parameter to handle submodules, ansible would track the
  submodule upstream's head revision.  This has been changed to checkout the
  version of the submodule specified in the superproject's git repository.
  This is inline with what git submodule update does.  If you want the old
  behaviour use the new module parameter track_submodules=yes
* Checksumming of transferred files has been made more portable and now uses
  the sha1 algorithm instead of md5 to be compatible with FIPS-140.
  - As a small side effect, the fetch module no longer returns a useful value
    in remote_md5.  If you need a replacement, switch to using remote_checksum
    which returns the sha1sum of the remote file.
* ansible-doc CLI tool contains various improvements for working with different terminals

* Added keepalive packets, so async mode is no longer required for long-running tasks.
* Modified accelerate daemon to use the verbose logging level of the ansible command that started it.
* Fixed bug where accelerate would not work in check-mode.
* Added a -vvvv level, which will show SSH client debugging information in the event of a failure.
* Fixed bug in apt_repository module where the repository cache was not being updated.

## 1.3.1 "Top of the World" (reprise) - September 16th, 2013

Fixing a bug in accelerate mode whereby the gather_facts step would always be run via sudo regardless of the play settings.

## 1.3 "Top of the World" - September 13th, 2013

Highlighted new features:

* accelerated mode: An enhanced fireball mode that requires zero bootstrapping and fewer requirements plus adds capabilities like sudo commands.
* role defaults: Allows roles to define a set of variables at the lowest priority. These variables can be overridden by any other variable.
* new /etc/ansible/facts.d allows JSON or INI-style facts to be provided from the remote node, and supports executable fact programs in this dir. Files must end in *.fact.
* added the ability to make undefined template variables raise errors (see ansible.cfg)
* (DOCS PENDING) sudo: True/False and sudo_user: True/False can be set at include and role level

* external inventory scripts may now return host variables in one pass, which allows them to be much more efficient for large numbers of hosts
* if --forks exceeds the numbers of hosts, it will be automatically reduced. Set forks to 0 and you get "as many forks as I have hosts" out of the box.
* enabled error_on_undefined_vars by default, which will make errors in playbooks more obvious
* role dependencies -- one role can now pull in another, with parameters of its own.
* added the ability to have tasks execute even during a check run (always_run).

## 1.2.3 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- Aug 21, 2013

* Local security fixes for predictable file locations for ControlPersist and retry file paths on shared machines
on operating systems without kernel symlink/hardlink protections.

## 1.2.2 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- July 4, 2013

* Added a configuration file option [paramiko_connection] record_host_keys which allows the code that paramiko uses
to update known_hosts to be disabled.  This is done because paramiko can be very slow at doing this if you have a
large number of hosts and some folks may not want this behavior.  This can be toggled independently of host key checking
and does not affect the ssh transport plugin.  Use of the ssh transport plugin is preferred if you have ControlPersist
capability, and Ansible by default in 1.2.1 and later will autodetect.

## 1.2.1 "Hear About It Later" -- July 4, 2013

* Connection default is now "smart", which discovers if the system openssh can support ControlPersist, and uses
  it if so, if not falls back to paramiko.
* Host key checking is on by default.  Disable it if you like by adding host_key_checking=False in the [default]
  section of /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or ~/ansible.cfg or by exporting ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
* Paramiko now records host keys it was in contact with host key checking is on.  It is somewhat sluggish when doing this,
  so switch to the 'ssh' transport if this concerns you.

## 1.2 "Right Now" -- June 10, 2013

Core Features:

* capability to set 'all_errors_fatal: True' in a playbook to force any error to stop execution versus
  a whole group or serial block needing to fail
  usable, without breaking the ability to override in ansible
* ability to use variables from {{ }} syntax in mainline playbooks, new 'when' conditional, as detailed
  in documentation.  Can disable old style replacements in ansible.cfg if so desired, but are still active
  by default.
* can set ansible_ssh_private_key_file as an inventory variable (similar to ansible_ssh_host, etc)
* 'when' statement can be affixed to task includes to auto-affix the conditional to each task therein
* cosmetic: "*****" banners in ansible-playbook output are now constant width
* --limit can now be given a filename (--limit @filename) to constrain a run to a host list on disk
* failed playbook runs will create a retry file in /var/tmp/ansible usable with --limit
* roles allow easy arrangement of reusable tasks/handlers/files/templates
* pre_tasks and post_tasks allow for separating tasks into blocks where handlers will fire around them automatically
* "meta: flush_handler" task capability added for when you really need to force handlers to run
* new --start-at-task option to ansible playbook allows starting at a specific task name in a long playbook
* added a log file for ansible/ansible-playbook, set 'log_path' in the configuration file or ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH in environment
* debug mode always outputs debug in playbooks, without needing to specify -v
* external inventory script added for Spacewalk / Red Hat Satellite servers
* It is now possible to feed JSON structures to --extra-vars.  Pass in a JSON dictionary/hash to feed in complex data.
* group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories can now be kept alongside the playbook as well as inventory (or both!)
* more filters: ability to say {{ foo|success }} and {{ foo|failed }} and when: foo|success and when: foo|failed
* more filters: {{ path|basename }} and {{ path|dirname }}
* lookup plugins now use the basedir of the file they have included from, avoiding needs of ../../../ in places and
increasing the ease at which things can be reorganized.

* you can set ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=1 to force color mode even when running without a TTY
* fatal errors are now properly colored red.
* skipped messages are now cyan, to differentiate them from unchanged messages.
* extensive documentation upgrades
* delegate_action to localhost (aka local_action) will always use the local connection type

Highlighted playbook changes:

* is_set is available for use inside of an only_if expression:  is_set('ansible_eth0').  We intend to further upgrade this with a 'when'
  keyword providing better options to 'only_if' in the next release.   Also is_unset('ansible_eth0')
* playbooks can import playbooks in other directories and then be able to import tasks relative to them
* FILE($path) now allows access of contents of file in a path, very good for use with SSH keys
* similarly PIPE($command) will run a local command and return the results of executing this command
* if all hosts in a play fail, stop the playbook, rather than letting the console log spool on by
* only_if using register variables that are booleans now works in a boolean way like you'd expect
* task includes now work with with_items (such as: include: path/to/wordpress.yml user=$item)
* when using a $list variable with $var or ${var} syntax it will automatically join with commas
* setup is not run more than once when we know it is has already been run in a play that included another play, etc
* can set/override sudo and sudo_user on individual tasks in a play, defaults to what is set in the play if not present
* ability to use with_fileglob to iterate over local file patterns
* templates now use Jinja2's 'trim_blocks=True' to avoid stray newlines, small changes to templates may
be required in rare cases.

Other playbook changes:

* to_yaml and from_yaml are available as Jinja2 filters
* $group and $group_names are now accessible in with_items
* where 'stdout' is provided a new 'stdout_lines' variable (type == list) is now generated and usable with with_items
* when local_action is used the transport is automatically overridden to the local type
* output on failed playbook commands is now nicely split for stderr/stdout and syntax errors
* if local_action is not used and delegate_to was 127.0.0.1 or localhost, use local connection regardless
* when running a playbook, and the statement has changed, prints 'changed:' now versus 'ok:' so it is obvious without colored mode
* variables now usable within vars_prompt (just not host/group vars)
* setup facts are now retained across plays (dictionary just gets updated as needed)
* --sudo-user now works with --extra-vars
* fix for multi_line strings with only_if

New Modules:

* ini_file module for manipulating INI files
* new LSB facts (release, distro, etc)
* pause module -- (pause seconds=10) (pause minutes=1) (pause prompt=foo) -- it's an action plugin
* a module for adding entries to the main crontab (though you may still wish to just drop template files into cron.d)
* debug module can be used for outputing messages without using 'shell echo'
* a fail module is now available for causing errors, you might want to use it with only_if to fail in certain conditions

* removes= exists on command just like creates=
* postgresql modules now take an optional port= parameter
* /proc/cmdline info is now available in Linux facts
* public host key detection for OS X

* additional facts for SunOS virtualization
* copy module is now atomic when used across volumes
* url_get module now returns 'dest' with the location of the file saved
* fix for yum module when using local RPMs vs downloading
* cleaner error messages with copy if destination directory does not exist

* service module status now correct for services with 'subsys locked' status
* misc fixes/upgrades to the wait_for module
* git module now expands any "~" in provided destination paths
* ignore stop error code failure for service module with state=restarted, always try to start
* inline documentation for modules allows documentation source to built without pull requests to the ansible-docs project, among other things
