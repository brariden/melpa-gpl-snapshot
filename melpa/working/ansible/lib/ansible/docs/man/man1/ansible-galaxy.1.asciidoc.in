NAME
----
ansible-galaxy - manage roles using galaxy.ansible.com


SYNOPSIS
--------
ansible-galaxy [init|info|install|list|remove] [--help] [options] ...


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*Ansible Galaxy* is a shared repository for Ansible roles (added in
ansible version 1.2). The ansible-galaxy command can be used to manage
these roles, or by creating a skeleton framework for roles you'd like
to upload to Galaxy.

COMMON OPTIONS
--------------

*-h*, *--help*::

Show a help message related to the given sub-command.


INSTALL
-------

The *install* sub-command is used to install roles.

USAGE
~~~~~

$ ansible-galaxy install [options] [-r FILE | role_name(s)[,version] | tar_file(s)]

Roles can be installed in several different ways:

* A username.rolename[,version] - this will install a single role. The Galaxy 
  API will be contacted to provide the information about the role, and the 
  corresponding .tar.gz will be downloaded from *github.com*. If the version 
  is omitted, the most recent version available will be installed.

* A file name, using *-r* - this will install multiple roles listed one per
  line. The format of each line is the same as above: username.rolename[,version]

* A .tar.gz of a valid role you've downloaded directly from *github.com*. This
  is mainly useful when the system running Ansible does not have access to 
  the Galaxy API, for instance when behind a firewall or proxy.


OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

*-f*, *--force*::

Force overwriting an existing role.

*-i*, *--ignore-errors*::

Ignore errors and continue with the next specified role.

*-n*, *--no-deps*::

Don't download roles listed as dependencies.

*-p* 'ROLES_PATH', *--roles-path=*'ROLES_PATH'::

The path to the directory containing your roles. The default is the *roles_path* 
configured in your *ansible.cfg* file (/etc/ansible/roles if not configured)

*-r* 'ROLE_FILE', *--role-file=*'ROLE_FILE'::

A file containing a list of roles to be imported, as specified above. This
option cannot be used if a rolename or .tar.gz have been specified.

$ ansible-galaxy remove role1 role2 ...
