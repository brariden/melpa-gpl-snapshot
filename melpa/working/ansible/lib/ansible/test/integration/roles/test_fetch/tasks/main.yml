- name: create a file that we can use to fetch
  copy: content="test" dest={{ output_dir }}/orig

- name: fetch the motd
  fetch: src={{ output_dir }}/orig dest={{ output_dir }}/fetched
  register: fetched

- debug: var=fetched

# TODO: check the sudo and non-sudo forms of fetch because in one form we'll do
# the get method of the connection plugin and in the sudo case we'll use the
# fetch module.

- name: diff what we fetched with the original file
  shell: diff {{ output_dir }}/orig {{ output_dir }}/fetched/127.0.0.1{{ output_dir | expanduser }}/orig
  register: diff

  assert:
    that:
      'diff.stdout == ""'
