ansible-modules-extras
======================

This repo contains a subset of ansible-modules with slightly lower use or priority than "core" modules.

All new modules should be submitted here, and have a chance to be promoted to core over time.

Take care to submit tickets to the appropriate repo where modules are contained. The docs.ansible.com website indicates this at the bottom of each module documentation page.
