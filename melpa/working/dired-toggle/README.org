*** Description
    =dired-toggle= provide an simple way to toggle dired buffer for
    current directory(similar to =dired-jump=), and the target buffer
    is specified so that it will be divided from other dired buffers,
    for example the dired buffer only shown in a special name which
    could be edit through the variable =dired-toggle-buffer-name=, and
    it will include a minor mode named =dired-toggle-mode= to ensure
    all the actions under the dired buffer(such as change directory
    and open a selected file) will not influence other dired buffers
    and works as we expected.

    You could custom the toggled window's size and side through
    variable =dired-toggle-window-size= and
    =dired-toggle-window-side=.

    *Tips*: For a good user experience you may want to use
    =dired-details.el= or =dired-hide-details-mode= if use Emacs 24.4
    or later.

*** Install
    You could install it easily through [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/getting-started][melpa]] by typing =M-x
    package-install dired-toggle=

*** Usage
    Just add the following to your =.emacs=:

    You could also custom functions after =dired-toggle-mode= enabled,
    for example enable =visual-line-mode= for our narrow dired buffer:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-hook 'dired-toggle-mode-hook
              (lambda () (interactive)
                (visual-line-mode 1)
                (setq-local visual-line-fringe-indicators '(nil right-curly-arrow))
                (setq-local word-wrap nil)))
    #+END_SRC
