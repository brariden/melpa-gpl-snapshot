;; ** What

;; =emacsshot= provides a few commands to take a screenshot of
;; Emacs from within Emacs.

;; [[./emacsshot.png]]

;; ** Usage

;; *** Quick

;; With =emacsshot= there are

;; - =M-x emacsshot-snap-frame=
;; - =M-x emacsshot-snap-window=
;; - =M-x emacsshot-snap-window-exclude-modeline=

;; for creating a shot of Emacs.

;; *** Hints and Detais

;; With the default settings =M-x emacsshot-snap-frame= creates file
;; '~/emacsshot.png' which is a snapshot of the current Emacs-frame
;; with all its windows.

;; There is also =M-x emacsshot-snap-window= which is for creating a
;; snapshot of the current Emacs-window (i.e. the window which contains
;; the active cursor.)

;; Further there is function =emacsshot-snap-window-exclude-modeline=
;; which does as =emacsshot-snap-window= but excludes the modeline when
;; taking the shot.  See also section [[id:db4e64e2-b400-4ec5-a393-9c5046720478][Hide the mode-line]].

;; The filenames are configurable.  Hint: =M-x customize-group emacsshot=.

;; It's also possible to add a timestamp to the filename as postfix.  See
;; =M-x customize-variable emacsshot-with-timestamp=.

;; It might be a good idea to bind the functions to a key.  This can
;; make the usage more convenient.  Further the binding is a way to
;; avoid images which contain the command that has been used to create
;; the image e.g. "M-x emacsshot-snap-frame" in the minibuffer.
;; Beware of the heisenshot!

;; Concretely the print-key could trigger the shot.  Evaluation of

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (global-set-key [print] 'emacsshot-snap-frame)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; yields this behavior.

;; Or evaluate

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (global-set-key [print]
;;  (lambda (&optional current-window)
;;   (interactive "P")
;;   (if current-window (emacsshot-snap-window)
;;     (emacsshot-snap-frame))))
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; to be able to snap the frame by pressing the print-key and to snap the
;; current window by prefixing the keypress with C-u.

;; Note that emacsshot currently trys to overwrite any existing file with
;; the target name without asking.

;; *** Hide the mode-line
;; :PROPERTIES:
;; :ID:       db4e64e2-b400-4ec5-a393-9c5046720478
;; :END:

;; If you don't want the mode-line in your emacsshot you can switch it
;; off with ~hidden-mode-line-mode~ from Bastien Guerry available at
;; http://bzg.fr/emacs-hide-mode-line.html.

;; ** Install
;; *** Emacs Package

;; When emacsshot has been installed as elpa-package
;; [[http://melpa.org/#/emacsshot][file:http://melpa.org/packages/emacsshot-badge.svg]] then the functions
;; are available without need of further action.

;; *** Direct Install

;; Activate this program by loading it into Emacs and evaluate it with
;; =M-x eval-buffer=.

;; Automatically activate this program at Emacs start by adding the lines

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/...path to this program...")
;; (require 'emacsshot)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; to your .emacs or whatever you use for Emacs intitialization.

;; ** Dependencies

;; - Emacs is running under X.
;; - The programm =convert= of the ImageMagick-suite is available.

;; =convert= actually creates the snapshots.

;; ** Development
;; *** Lentic Literate Style

;; This program is written in Emacs Lisp in lentic style based on the
;; 'lentic' package [[http://melpa.org/#/lentic][file:http://melpa.org/packages/lentic-badge.svg]].

;; This means the that this file can be regarded just as an Emacs Lisp
;; file.  But actually this file contains extra comments which allow the
;; interpretation of the file as Org file.  Lentic-mode makes it easy to
;; write this style.

;; A possible initialization of lentic is this:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (global-lentic-start-mode)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; Find more about lentic at
;; [[http://melpa.org/#/lentic][file:http://melpa.org/packages/lentic-badge.svg]].

;; *** Ideas, Contributions, Bugs

;; Contributions, ideas and bug-reports are welcome.

;; Please use the infrastructure of github for communication.  See
;; https://github.com/marcowahl/emacsshot/issues.

;; ** Related

;; There is elpa-package 'screenshot' which allows to pick windows
;; with the mouse, even windows from non-Emacs (!) programs.  See
;; http://melpa.org/#/screenshot.  BTW 'screenshot' has even more!

;; emacsshot only takes images of Emacs.
