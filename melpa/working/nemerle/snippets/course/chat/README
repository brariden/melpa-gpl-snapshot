1. Compilation. 
Just type:

	make

To compile only server type:

	make server

To compile only client type:

	make client

2. Usage:
2.1 Starting server
Type:

	mono server

By default server listens to connections on port 3000. You can specify the port, by starting server:

	mono server PORT_NUMBER

where PORT_NUMBER is number of port to listen.

2.2 Starting client
Type:

	mono client

By default client looks for server in localhost on port 3000. You can specify server's host and port:

	mono client SERVER_HOST PORT_NUMBER

where SERVER_HOST is name of server's host, and PORT_NUMBER is number of port to connect.
When starting client, be sure, that there are both "nick.glade" and "gui.glade" files in working directory.
