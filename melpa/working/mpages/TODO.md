test should just exercise the calls just to make sure things work
doens't need to be right but just not crash, I could test that

travis-ci

# Future

could make time only count while in the buffer, currently
it just records start time, so if I step away to another
buffer it will keep the timer going. But really it should only
count while in that buffer. Timer tick should just add a second
and that count should get converted into a time and formatted


could check to see if running timer is the same as the buffer local
version. Not sure if that is possible with the timer method call
but that way it could restrict to the exact buffer that started the mode
and not if multiples are defined (would go well with counter above)

could look at directory and keep track of the streak
 in the headlines (or is that depressing -- turnoffable)

could check for ido and do ido read-directory-name


zoom font default +1
 could make it a setting
 and wordwrap a setting
