## Dpaste.el

dpaste.el provides functions to post a region or buffer to
<http://dpaste.com> and put the paste URL into the kill-ring.

## Installation and setup:

Put this file in a directory where Emacs can find it. On GNU/Linux
it's usually /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/ and on Windows it's
something like "C:\Program Files\Emacs<version>\site-lisp". Then
add the follow instructions in your .emacs.el:

```
(require 'dpaste nil)  ; Not needed if you use package.el
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'dpaste-region-or-buffer)
(setq dpaste-poster "Guido van Rossum")
;; or the preferred method of adding your `user-full-name variable
(setq user-full-name "Guido van Rossum")
```

With `C-c p` you can run `dpaste-region-or-buffer`. With a prefix
argument (`C-u C-c p`), your paste will use the hold option.
