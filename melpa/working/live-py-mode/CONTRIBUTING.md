Contributing to the Live Coding in Python Project
=================================================
If you like this project and want to make it better, help out. It could be as
simple as sending Don a nice note on [Google+][g+], you could report a bug,
or pitch in with some development work.

Bug Reports and Enhancement Requests
------------------------------------
Please create issue descriptions [on GitHub][issues]. Be as specific as possible.
Which version are you using? What did you do? What did you expect to happen? Are
you planning to submit your own fix in a pull request? Please include a small
code sample and what you would like the live code display to show for that code.

Development
-----------
Live Coding in Python is an Eclipse Plug-in, so you need the [Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)][pde]. You might find the [PDE tutorial][tutorial] helpful.

If you want to see what's currently being worked on, check out the [waffle board][waffle].

Running from source code
------------------------
1. You need to install the PDE. You can either install the standard edition of
   Eclipse that includes it, or you can open the Help menu, choose Eclipse
   Marketplace..., click on the Yoxos marketplace, search for PDE, and install it.
2. Open the plugin.xml file with the Plug-in Manifest Editor.
3. Click on the green play button to launch the Eclipse application.
4. Create a new PyDev project, add a Python file, and then turn on Live Coding.
5. Now you can hack on the live-py source code and see the results.

Creating an Install Package for the Eclipse plugin
--------------------------------------------------
Be sure that you test everything with the latest versions of [PyDev][pdrel] and
[Python][pyrel].

1. Check that all the Java unit tests run.
2. Check that all the Python unit tests run in the latest versions of both
   Python 2 and Python 3.
3. Open plugin/plugin.xml and feature/feature.xml, and increment the Version
    field in each file.
4. Commit the version changes, and push to GitHub.
5. Check out the `gh-pages` branch with the update project nested inside, and
    open the update project's `site.xml`.
6. Click the Add Feature... button, type "live", select `live_py_feature`
    from the list, and click OK.
7. Drag `live_py_feature` under the devtools group, and click the Build button.
8. Commit the new version files, push, and create a release on GitHub.
9. Update the version number on the [Ecplipse marketplace][mkt].
