The library provides [`avy`](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy)-powered popup
menu that allows to quickly choose from available options. This is used in
the following packages:

* [`ace-popup-menu`](https://github.com/mrkkrp/ace-popup-menu)
* [`char-menu`](https://github.com/mrkkrp/char-menu)

You can use it directly for your custom needs as well.

## Installation

Put it on your `load-path` and then add the following at the top of file
where you would like to use the menu:

```emacs-lisp
(require 'avy-menu)
```

That's it. Don't forget to include it in your list of dependencies if you
are writing an Emacs Lisp package:

```emacs-lisp
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.5") (avy-menu "0.1"))
```

To install the package via MELPA, type <kbd>M-x package-install avy-menu
RET</kbd>.
