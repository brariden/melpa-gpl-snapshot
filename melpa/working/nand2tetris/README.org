** Goodies

Using =C-c C-c= will call =nand2tetris/tests-current-hdl-elsewhere= which is the same as
running:

#+begin_src sh
    HardwareSimulator.sh FILE.tst    Starts the Hardware Simulator and runs the
                                     FILE.tst test script.  The success/failure
                                     message is printed to the command console.
#+end_src

And printing the result in the modeline, it looks like this:
