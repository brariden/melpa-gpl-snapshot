This Wiki uses [[Farkup]] to mark up text.

Two special article names are recognized by the Wiki: [[Contents]] and [[Footer]]. They do not exist by default, but if you create them, they will be visible on every page.

The Wiki supports hierarchical article organization. You can separate components in article names with slashes, and Wiki links only display the last component. An example: [[Factor/Features]].
