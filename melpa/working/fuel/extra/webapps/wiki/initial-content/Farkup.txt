Here is a paragraph of text, with _emphasized_ and *strong* text, together with an inline %code snippet%. Did you know that E=mc^2^, and L~2~ spaces are cool? Of course, if you want to include \_ special \* characters \^ you \~ can \% do that, too.

You can make [[Wiki Links]] just like that, as well as links to external sites: [[http://sbcl.sourceforge.net]]. [[Factor|Custom link text]] can be used [[http://www.apple.com|with both types of links]].

Images can be embedded in the text:

Unordered lists:

- a list
- with three
- items

Ordered lists:

# a list
# with three
# numbered items

Horizontal lines:

___

Tables:

|a table|with|four|columns|
|and|two|rows|...|

Here is some code:

[{HAI
CAN HAS STDIO?
VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!"
KTHXBYE}]

There is syntax highlighting for various languages, too:

[factor{PEG: parse-request-line ( string -- triple )
    #! Triple is { method url version }
    [ 
        'space' ,
        'http-method' ,
        'space' ,
        'url' ,
        'space' ,
        'http-version' ,
        'space' ,
    ] seq* just ;}]

Some Java:

[java{/**
 * Returns the extension of the specified filename, or an empty
 * string if there is none.
 * @param path The path
 */
public static String getFileExtension(String path)
{
    int fsIndex = getLastSeparatorIndex(path);
    int index = path.lastIndexOf('.');
    // there could be a dot in the path and no file extension
    if(index == -1 || index < fsIndex )
        return "";
    else
        return path.substring(index);
}}]
