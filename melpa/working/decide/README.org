* decide-mode.el
Random decisions for emacs, with functions and a minor mode. Roll various types
of dice, generate random numbers from ranges, or generate random text from
tables. It was mostly inspired by tools and activities related to being
a game master in role-playing games, but are in no way restricted to
making random decisions in that context.

Results are inserted at point in active buffer if possible, otherwise only
echoed in the mini-buffer. The format is intended to make it possible to
integrate them in a text being written with decide-mode making it easy to press
? followed by various other keys to quickly get some random result inserted in
the buffer. A ? followed by space or enter will just insert the ? itself, so
normally decide-mode should not interfere with typing.

** Example Output
This is what it can look like when typing a text
in emacs with decide-mode enabled. All the functions
can be called outside of decide-mode as well of
course or bound to global shortcuts if you prefer.
All the decide-mode shortcuts have ? as a prefix.
The keys pressed have been awkwardly inserted in
the example text below.

- Answer yes an no questions. Like this? -> YES *(? ?)*
- Roll dice: [2d6] -> (5 1) = 6 *(? D)*
- Roll dice with modifier: [2d6+1] -> (5 3) +1 = 9 *(? d 2 d 6 + 1 RET)*
- Roll more unusual dice, like FATE/Fudge dice: [4dF] -> (- 0 + +) = 1 *(? F)*
- There are several special shortcuts for dice to save you some typing: [1d20] -> = 20 *(? 2 0)*
- Draw a cards: [<card>] -> 2 Clubs *(? t c a r d RET)*
- Pick a number from a range: [1-10] -> 5 *(? r 1 - 1 0 RET)*
- Pick a number from a range, but lower numbers more likely: [1-10 (lowest of 2)] -> 4 *(? r 1 < < 1 0 RET)*
- Make lower numbers even more likely by adding more signs: [1-10 (lowest of 4)] -> 1 *(? r 1 < < < < 1 0 RET)*
- Of course it works to make higher numbers more likely as well: [1-10 (highest of 3)] -> 9 *(? r 1 > > > 1 0 RET)*
- And you can make numbers closer to the center of the range: [1-10 (average of 3)] -> 4 *(? r 1 - - - 1 0 RET)*
- Random directions:
- [(N,S,E,W)] -> N *(? w 4)*
- [(N,S,E,W,NE,NW,SE,SW)] -> NW *(? w 8)*
- [(forward,left,right,back)] -> right *(? W 4)*
- ... and a few more like those.
- Generate strings from silly included example tables: [<example-dragon>] -> 3 ice dragons *(? t e x a m p l e - d TAB RET)*
- Another one: [<example-dragon>] -> cute dragon *(? t e x a m p l e - d TAB RET)*

(The variable decide-tables can be set up with the tables to generate
strings from and it can include die-rolls and ranges as well to
insert random numbers, and refer to other tables to build
up more complex texts.)

See the decide.el file itself for some documentation and a list of all the
kebindings in decide-mode.

* Help
Suggestions and bug-fixes are very much appreciated. This was
my first attempt at writing a mode for emacs, and I have very
little experience with elisp (or any lisp) in general.
