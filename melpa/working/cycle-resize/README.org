* Cycle resize

[[http://melpa.org/#/cycle-resize][file:http://melpa.org/packages/cycle-resize-badge.svg]]

/cycle-resize.el/ is a GNU/Emacs package that allows you to resize your window through a cycle of dimensions.

** Install

A package is available on MELPA. To install it, simply type =M-x package-install RET cycle-resize=

Or, if you want to install it from the source repository, just clone the /cycle-resize.el/ file in your emacs load-path.


** Usage

In your init file, simply add:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'cycle-resize)
#+end_src

Once you have at leat 2 windows, you can call interactive methods:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x cycle-resize-window-vertically
M-x cycle-resize-window-horizontally
#+end_src

And eventually, you can bind these keys to call the methods from your keyboard:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-v") 'cycle-resize-window-vertically)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-h") 'cycle-resize-window-horizontally)
#+end_src

You also can configure the dimensions (in %) the package will cycle through
By default, it is: 80% -> 50% -> 20% -> 50%, and so on...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq cycle-resize-steps '(80 50 20 50))
#+end_src
