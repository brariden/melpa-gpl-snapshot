[README for MU (English Version)]
by MORIOKA Tomohiko <morioka@jaist.ac.jp>

What's MU
=========

  MU stands for "Message Utilities".  It consists of following
  modules:

	mu-cite: a citation utility
	  mu-cite.el     --- main module of mu-cite
	  mu-bbdb.el     --- mu-cite submodule for BBDB
	  mu-register.el --- mu-cite submodule for registration

	latex-math-symbol.el --- translate mathematical symbols of
			     	 LaTeX into MULE characters

  It requires two packages APEL 10.7 or later and FLIM 1.12.2 or later.
  Please install them.


Installation
============

(a) run in expanded place

  If you don't want to install other directories, please do only
  following:

	% make

  You can specify the emacs command name, for example

	% make install EMACS=xemacs

  If `EMACS=...' is omitted, EMACS=emacs is used.

(b) make install

  If you want to install other directories, please do following:

	% make install

  You can specify the emacs command name, for example

	% make install EMACS=xemacs

  If `EMACS=...' is omitted, EMACS=emacs is used.

  You can specify the prefix of the directory tree for Emacs Lisp
  programs and shell scripts, for example:

	% make install PREFIX=~/

  If `PREFIX=...' is omitted, the prefix of the directory tree of the
  specified emacs command is used (perhaps /usr/local).

  For example, if PREFIX=/usr/local and EMACS 19.34 is specified, it
  will create the following directory tree:

	/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu/   --- MU

  You can specify site-lisp directory, for example:

	% make install LISPDIR=~/share/emacs/lisp

  If `LISPDIR=...' is omitted, site-lisp directory of the specified
  emacs command is used (perhaps /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp or
  /usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-lisp).

  If the emu modules (included in APEL package) have been installed in
  the non-standard directory, you should specify where they will be
  found, for example:

	% make install VERSION_SPECIFIC_LISPDIR=~/elisp

  You can specify other optional settings by editing the file
  MU-CFG.  Please read comments in it.

(c) install as a XEmacs package

  If you want to install to XEmacs package directory, please do
  following:

	% make install-package

  You can specify the XEmacs command name, for example

	% make install-package XEMACS=xemacs-21

  If `XEMACS=...' is omitted, XEMACS=xemacs is used.

  You can specify the package directory, for example:

	% make install PACKAGEDIR=~/.xemacs

  If `PACKAGEDIR=...' is omitted, the first existing package
  directory is used.

  Notice that XEmacs package system requires XEmacs 21.0 or later.


load-path (for Emacs or MULE)
=============================

  If you are using Emacs or Mule, please add directory of mu to
  load-path.  If you install by default setting, you can write
  subdirs.el for example:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '("apel" "flim" "mu"))
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you are using XEmacs, there are no need of setting about
  load-path.
