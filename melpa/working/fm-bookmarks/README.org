* fm-bookmarks.el

  Use existed file managers' (FM) bookmarks in Dired.

** Introduce
   If you're using Dired, you may want to directly access existed
   bookmarks in your prefered file manager (e.g. Dolphin, Nautilus,
   PCManFM) via Dired, without any redundant configuration for Dired
   or `balahbalah-bookmarks.el`. If so, =fm-bookmarks.el= is just what
   you're looking for.

   =fm-bookmarks.el= also has an experimental feature to list mounted
   media (via =mount= shell command, due to the limitation of the crap
   Emacs Lisp).

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   =fm-bookmarks.el= currently supports:

   - Dolphin (KDE 4 & 5)
   - Nautilus
   - PCManFM

   because I have no Windows & Mac, sorry. :sweat:

   However, *without supported FMs, you still can use custom bookmarks*.

   If you can, please feel free to send a PR, or give me an example bookmarks file (& its path) of the other FMs. Thank you! :pray:
