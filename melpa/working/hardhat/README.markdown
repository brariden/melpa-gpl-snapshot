## Quickstart

```elisp
(require 'hardhat)
 
(global-hardhat-mode 1)
 
;; now you are protected from editing:
;;
;;     .git/index
;;     ~/.emacs.d/elpa/hardhat-0.1.0/hardhat.el
;;     ~/.emacs~
;;
;; and many others
```

## Explanation

A recent unwholesome trend is for package managers to install files
in locations such as `~/.cabal/`, `~/.rvm/`, or `~/.emacs.d/elpa/`.
It is rarely meant for such files to be edited; doing so can cause
data loss in some circumstances.

In addition, many user-writable files created in the course of
ordinary work should never be altered by a text editor, *eg* the
database stored in a `.git` directory.

`hardhat.el` provides an extra layer of protection in your work.  If
you visit a file which looks unsafe to edit, Emacs will make the
buffer read-only -- even when the underlying file is writable.

The read-only protection can be turned off for a buffer by the
usual methods, or by toggling off buffer-local `hardhat-mode` via
the lighter menu or

<kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>hardhat-mode</kbd> <kbd>RET</kbd>

If a buffer is not visiting a file, `hardhat-mode` has no effect.
If the visited file is not writable by the user, `hardhat-mode`
has no effect.

To use hardhat, place the `hardhat.el` library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your `~/.emacs` file:

```elisp
(require 'hardhat)
(global-hardhat-mode 1)
```

To inquire as to why hardhat has set or unset protection in
a buffer, the following interactive command is provided

	hardhat-status

but not bound to any key.

## Notes

`hardhat-mode` takes no action until the user attempts an
interactive command in a buffer.  This is (out of an abundance
of caution) for compatibility: an Emacs Lisp library may freely
open and write to a file protected by `hardhat-mode`, so long as
it is done programatically.

For any of the options settable in `customize`, rules making
buffers "editable" override rules making buffers "protected".

A Boolean file-local variable `hardhat-protect` is provided.
When `hardhat-protect` is set to either t or nil, no other
rules are consulted.

Regular-expression matches are case-insensitive.  A case-
sensitive test can be implemented by adding custom function
to eg `hardhat-buffer-protected-functions`.

## Bugs

More exceptions are certainly needed in `hardhat-fullpath-editable-regexps`.

Because Emacs can wedge if `file-truename` is called on a
remote file (eg when using TRAMP), some filename tests used in
hardhat are not precisely equivalent between local and remote
files.  You can change this behavior by setting
`hardhat-use-unsafe-remote-truename` via `customize`.  A better
solution is to set `find-file-visit-truename` globally.
