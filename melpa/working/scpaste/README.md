# SCPaste

This will place an HTML copy of a buffer on the web on a server to
which the user has SSH access.

It's similar in purpose to services such as http://paste.lisp.org or
http://rafb.net, but it's much simpler since it assumes the user has
an account on a publicly-accessible HTTP server. It uses `scp' as
its transport and uses Emacs' font-lock as its syntax highlighter
instead of relying on a third-party syntax highlighter for which
individual language support must be added one-by-one.

## Installation

Install via [Marmalade](https://marmalade-repo.org) or from source via
<tt>M-x package-install-from-buffer</tt>.

You'll need to configure your destination:

    (setq scpaste-http-destination "http://p.hagelb.org"
          scpaste-scp-destination "p.hagelb.org:p.hagelb.org")

`scpaste-scp-destination` should be an `scp`-accessible directory that
is also served over HTTP. `scpaste-http-destination` should be the URL
that corresponds to that directory.

If you have a different keyfile, you can set that, too:

    (setq scpaste-scp-pubkey "~/.ssh/my_keyfile.pub")

Optionally you can set the displayed name and where it should link to:

    (setq scpaste-user-name "Technomancy"
          scpaste-user-address "http://technomancy.us/")

You probably want to set up SSH keys for your destination to avoid
having to enter your password once for each paste. Also be sure the
key of the host referenced in `scpaste-scp-destination' is in your
known hosts file--scpaste will not prompt you to add it but will
simply hang.

## Usage

`M-x scpaste`, (or `scpaste-region`) enter a name, and press
return. The name will be incorporated into the URL by escaping it and
adding it to the end of `scpaste-http-destination`. The URL for the
pasted file will be pushed onto the kill ring.

Two files will be uploaded: the HTML version as well as the raw
version. The HTML version simply has ".html" on the end of the name,
and it includes a link to the raw version at the bottom. (Customize
`scpaste-footer` to adjust the look of this link.)

You can autogenerate a splash page that gets uploaded as index.html
in `scpaste-http-destination` by invoking `M-x scpaste-index`. This
will upload an explanation as well as a listing of existing
pastes. If a paste's filename includes "private" it will be skipped.

## Todo

* Automatically linkify URLs inside htmlfontify (stick it on the
  hfy-opts group of misc tunables according to fledermaus)
