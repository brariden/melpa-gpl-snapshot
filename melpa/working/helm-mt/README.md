# helm-mt
Helm bindings for managing multi-term terminals

Create and delete terminals in `term` or `shell` mode  easily with Helm

A call to `helm-mt` will show a list of running terminal sessions
by examining buffers with major mode `term-mode` or `shell-mode`.  From there, you
should be able to create, delete or switch over to existing
terminal buffers

# Setup
Invoke `helm-mt` and bind it to a keyboard shortcut

```
(require 'helm-mt)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x t") 'helm-mt)
```

If you would like to have `helm-mt` run when you do `M-x term` or `M-x shell`,
then put this in your init file:

```
(helm-mt/wrap-shells t)
```

To deactivate the advice pass `nil` instead of `t`.
