His library [[https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/user/jtkohl/elisp/out-xtra.el][out-xtra.el]] was first modified and expanded into library
[[https://github.com/tj64/outxxtra][outxxtra]]. That library was then later-on merged into outshine.el.

Library outline-mode-easy-bindings.el was extracted from the [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/OutlineMinorMode][Emacs
Wiki]] and merged into outshine.el. Its author is unknown.

To avoid the legal issues introduced by this anonymous code, commit
b812d4550c1257cc48bd4296c323eba4fe5dd113 would have to been splitted
in parts and partly reversed. outline-mode-easy-bindings.el could then
be used as a soft (external) requirement of outshine.el.

Of course this macro isn't trivial from a programmers point of view,
its a rather sophisticated contribution. But since its just a few
lines of code, signing of FSF papers isn't necessary (its a trivial
contribution from a legal point of view).
