* 1.2.0

  - Add =desktop-registry-list-desktops= command for easy management of
    registered desktops.

  - Use =file-name-nondirectory= instead of =file-name-base= when naming a
    new desktop. This way these names won't lose anything after a ~.~
    (dot).

  - Update documentation strings and comments.

  - Add =URL= header to module.

* 1.1.0

  - Add =desktop-registry-remove-desktop= command to remove desktops you
    no longer (want to) use.

  - Add =desktop-registry-current-desktop= function to get the name of
    the currently loaded desktop.

  - Add =desktop-registry-rename-desktop= command to rename a desktop.

  - Specify prompts for each action that wants a desktop selected.

  - Allow specifying of desktop name by using the universal argument.

  - Signal an error when the name for a desktop (either specified or
    generated) already exists in the registry and show a message when
    the specified directory has already been registered. Only add the
    directory if neither of these conditions occur.
