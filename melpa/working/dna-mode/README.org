  A collection of functions for editing DNA sequences.  It
  provides functions to make editing dna in Emacs easier.

  Dna-mode will:
  -  Fontify keywords and line numbers in sequences.
  -  Fontify bases when font-lock-mode is disabled.
  -  Incrementally search dna over pads and numbers.
  -  Complement and reverse complement a region.
  -  Move over bases and entire sequences.
  -  Detect sequence files by content.

* dna-primer.el
  Generates primers for sequences within emacs.
