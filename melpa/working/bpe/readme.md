### Configuration

Write below configuration to your emacs configuration file.

```lisp
(require 'bpe)
(require 'htmlize nil 'noerror) ; to fontify source code block on your blog.
(setq bpe:account "your mail address on google blogger")
(setq bpe:blog-name "your blog name")
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-p") 'bpe:post-article)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-i") 'bpe:insert-template)
;; For Japanese, default is $LANG environment variable.
(setq bpe:lang "ja_JP.UTF-8")
```

### Usage
Insert org-mode option to blogging org-mode file by M-x bpe:insert-template.
(The OPTIONS is optional. You can change it at bpe:template variable.)

    #+TITLE: How to post my blog from Emacs and org-mode?
    #+OPTIONS: toc:nil \n:nil num:nil
    #+TAGS: Emacs Blog
    #+AUTHOR: shark

The TITLE is your Blogger's title. If you didn't specify it, then ask
from minibuffer.

The TAGS is your Blogger's tag.
This example's result is Emacs and Blog. It must separate space and can't use ",".

M-x bpe:post-article on org-mode file and then current org-mode file
is posted to your Blogger. If you do this command after you push C-u
command, then this program will delete same title's article.(update
command)
Maybe first time is you need to accept this program from browser.

### Compatibility

I'm testing org-version 8.3beta.

### Note
bpe.el had below problem until version 0.1.0, but it was solved from the version.(probably)

~~Google Blogger service is inserting newline to the blog if its HTML file have newline. So I created to minify html that org-mode output. But it didn't solve problem. Because org-mode insert newline into html content's first and end. For example `<p>\n CONTENT \n</p>`. So this program deleting those newline by Emacs's regexp replacement. Therefore if you use HTML tag in your blog, this program may delete newline from your blog's html tag(for example, in org-src-block's html)~~
