## Installation & Usage

### Emacs 24

If you're using [MELPA][] there's a `twilight-anti-bright-theme` package
available. Otherwise follow these instructions:

[melpa]: http://melpa.milkbox.net/

1. Add the `twilight-anti-bright-theme` directory to your Emacs `load-path`
   and `custom-theme-load-path`.
2. Add one of the following to your Emacs init file:
    - `(require 'twilight-anti-bright-theme)`
    - `(load-theme twilight-anti-bright t)`
3. Reload the init file, or restart Emacs.

### TextMate

_**Note**: I no longer maintain the TextMate version._

1. Download [Twilight Anti-Bright.tmtheme][tmtheme] and open it with TextMate.
2. Done.

## Todos

* Potentially improve TextMate version. It was thrown together really quickly
  without getting much use as I personally don't use TextMate anymore.
