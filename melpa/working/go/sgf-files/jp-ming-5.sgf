(;EV[Famous Blood Vomiting Game]DT[1835-07-27]PC[Japan]PB[Akaboshi Intetsu]BR[7p]PW[Honinbo Jowa]WR[9p]RE[W+R]SZ[19]C[This is the most famous game in Japanese Go History, not only because Honinbo Jowa played the three famous moves in this game(W68, W70 and W78 were considered as the clever moves of no category in ancient and modern time), and also because Akaboshi Intetsu vomited blood and died after he lost this match, it is the most saddened tragic in Go history.];B[cp]C[Akaboshi Intetsu was the student of Gennan Inseki 8p, at the age of 24, he advanced to 7p and was a new star in his family. After losing the game, he vomited blood and died at only 25 years' old.];W[pq]C[Honinbo Jowa is Honinbo #12, he was a very talented player, famous in his middle game fight and precise and deep calculation.];B[qd]C[Jowa used some strategy to obtain Meijin without any effort. Gennan Inseki, who is also Meijin, certainly was not convinced. But he lacks confidence if he directly challenges Jowa, so he sent his student to play with Jowa.];W[ed];B[oc]
;W[eq];B[qo];W[qk];B[qi];W[op];B[iq];W[dn]C[The Great Slant joseki was very popular at that time.];B[ep];W[dp];B[do];W[dq];B[co];W[eo]
;B[fp];W[cq];B[bq]LB[cn:a]C[B21: Normally Black would extend at 'a', the play in the game is also one variation of the Great Slant joseki.];W[br];B[cm];W[gr];B[hp];W[en];B[bp];W[ck]C[W28 is Jowa's unique and fight-oriented style.];B[dl]
;W[dk];B[el];W[gn];B[cr]C[B33 is a very thoughtful move.];W[dr];B[bs]C[B33 and B35 are correlated good moves.];W[fq]LB[ar:a][fr:b][ds:c]C[White has no choice, if White elects to descend at 'a', then B36, W 'b' and B 'c', leading to a ko, White is no good.];B[go];W[ar]C[So far, White has gained a little in the corner, however...]
;B[hn]C[The hane of B39 is also very strong.];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[ek]C[Through B43, the efficiency of Black's making the first move is still obvious.];W[hl];B[di];W[io];B[ho];W[fo]C[W46 and W48 are good sequence plays.];B[ch]LB[gp:a][bk:b]C[B49: If Black connects at 'a', then White will descend at 'b'.]
;W[cd];B[lq];W[pn];B[gc]C[B53 is an eye-catching big point.];W[qn];B[dc]C[The strike of B55 is severe!];W[cc];B[ec]LB[eb:a][cb:b]C[B57 is questionable and no better than the diagonal's extension at 'a', although there is only one line difference, but next because of the hane at 'b', White's corner would be still not safe.];W[cf];B[il]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first time, Black is a little favorable.]
;W[gp]C[W60: White takes two stones and it is a thick play.];B[nq]LB[jd:a]C[B61 is a questionable move, now Black should make an extension at 'a', this way Black would still keep the lead.];W[ic];B[fd];W[lc]C[White easily plays the two-space extension with W62 and W64,  it now becomes a close game.];B[bg];W[bf];B[af]C[With B65 and B67, Black wants to take advantage in sente, but there is some aji still left on the left side, therefore White adopts an excellent maneuver ...];W[bi]C[W68 is considered as "the clever move of non-category in ancient and modern time".];B[dj]LB[bm:a]C[B69: Black can't tenuki, because White can attach at 'a'.]
;W[eh]C[W70 is again a clever move, Black still can't tenuki.];B[fj]LB[dh:a][cg:b][qg:c]C[After Black reinforces with B71, because W 'a' and W 'b' are all sente now, so White has already settled his upper left corner, White's clever moves turn gote into sente and White gets to invade at 'c', instantly White becomes slightly favorable in the game.];W[qg];B[oi];W[qe];B[pd];W[nf];B[ok];W[pk]LB[rl:a][ri:b]C[After the cap of B77, W78 is the third clever move in this game. W78 prevents Black from striking at 'a' and also makes the attachment at 'b' effective.]
;B[ol]C[Black elects to extend with B79, making the strongest resistance.];W[pj]C[However after White turns with W80, the defect in Black's shape has been clearly exposed.];B[rn];W[rm];B[qq]C[Black invades the corner with B81 and B83, which are game-deciding moves, Black has to play this way in order to have a chance of winning.];W[qr];B[rr];W[qp]C[W86 is the right move.];B[rq];W[pr];B[rp]LB[po:a]C[Black has missed the last chance, if Black pushes at 'a', Black would still have a chance.]
;W[po];B[pp];W[mp]LB[oq:a][np:b]C[W92 is a good move, Black can't cut at 'a' to initiate the ko, because the connection of W 'b' is a local ko threat, Black has no chance to win the ko fight.];B[qm];W[pm]C[W94: White is resolute and decisive, Black dares not extend B93, so Black has incurred loss again.];B[np];W[mq];B[mo];W[lp];B[lo]C[After this move, the game was closed for the second time, now White already takes control of the game.]
;W[kp];B[no];W[nr];B[or];W[qp];B[mr];W[ro]C[White simply eliminates the ko, White is already favorable in the game.];B[pi]C[Black connects back one stone, otherwise Black's territory would be inadequate. But now Black still doesn't reinforce the bottom.];W[lr];B[ns];W[ip]C[W108 and W100 are decisively attacking moves.];B[jr]LB[hq:a][jq:b]C[B111: Black goes all out to fight back, if Black connects at 'a',  then W 'b', next because White can play at 111 to live in sente, Black would be still losing.]
;W[hq];B[jn];W[ko];B[kq]LB[kn:a][jq:b]C[B115: If Black blocks at 'a', then White will play at 'b', Black is no good either.];W[kn]LB[jo:a]C[After White pushes out with W116, because W 'a' is sente, Black's defensive line has been broken and Black is hard to handle.];B[jm];W[km];B[ik];W[mk]C[With W120, White manages to settle himself and also aims to attack Black, showing Jowa's incomparable fighting strength, Black's situation has further deteriorated.]
;B[mm];W[ir];B[jq]LB[jo:a]C[In fact, the exchange of W122 and B123 is unnecessary, because W 'a' becomes not sente any more, Jowa must think White's advantage is clear so that he elects to simply settle the shape this way.];W[kk];B[mi];W[nm]LB[ls:a]C[W126: White cuts Black's connection. What's worth noticing is that, after the exchange of W122 and B123, when the time is ripe, White can descend at 'a', Black at the bottom is still not completely alive.];B[ml];W[ki];B[lj];W[lk]
;B[kj];W[jj];B[kl];W[ll];B[lm];W[oj];B[mg]LB[jl:a]C[B137: Black has no choice, if Black connects at 'a', Black on the right side would sink into a hopeless situation.];W[jl];B[jk];W[nj];B[ni];W[im]C[White starts the ko with W142, which is cleverly managed, this ko is much heavier for Black, White completely takes control of the game. So far, Jowa's talent has been thoroughly showed on the board.]

;B[hj]C[W164 is a very strong move, forcing Black to connect with B165 and B169.];W[oe];B[kg];W[jg]C[After this move, the game was closed for the third and last time, now Black is already in a desperate situation.];B[gi]C[Black has no alternative but to reinforce with B173.];W[nc]C[W174: White presses Black's corner and also aims to attack Black in the center from afar.];B[jf];W[nb];B[re];W[if];B[je]
