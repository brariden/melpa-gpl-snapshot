Highlight staged (quasi-quoted) expressions.

We can easily recognize what are evaluated now and what are quoted for
later evaluation.

*** MetaOCaml.

** Installation

Require this script

: (require 'highlight-stages)

and call function "highlight-stages-mode"

: (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'highlight-stages-mode)

If you want to enable "highlight-stages-mode" (almost) everywhere,
call "highlight-stages-global-mode" instead.

: (highlight-stages-global-mode 1)

** Supported Languages

Lisp-like languages, MetaOCaml, and C/C++ preprocessors.

** Customizations

5 faces

- =highlight-stages-negative-level-face=
- =highlight-stages-level-1-face=
- =highlight-stages-level-2-face=
- =highlight-stages-level-3-face=
- =highlight-stages-higher-level-face=

are all customizable.

When =highlight-stages-highlight-real-quote= is non-nil, not only
quasi-quotes(`) but also "real" quotes(') are highlighted.
