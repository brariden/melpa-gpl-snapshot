                             forecast.el

forecast.el generates a _weather forecast report_ and displays it in a
buffer.  It uses data  from Forecast.io (http://forecast.io), and thus
one  needs to  acquire an  api  key from  them  in order  to use  this
package.  They  allow 1000 requests  a day  in their free  plan, which
should be enough for any user.

See   the   file   `forecast.el'  for   details.    Installation   and
configuration process is detailed in the header comments.
