** Pre/post command support functions

Not sure how I can test these better -- but worth thinking about -- I guess do
some set up, then and buffer-local pre or post command, run some stuff,
compare.


Do these get called with "call-interactively"?


** Minor mode local and global activation

Tricky because global mode will affect all buffers.

This is a tricky one to preserve activation status, but it can work.





** Should call functions

Something to test whether a function has been called, and with what values.

Easy enough to do with advice.

** Better ERT batch output

ERT should output parsable error messages, with locations of files in batch.

Compile mode should actually pick this up!

** Sisyphus-compile

A compile mode for sisyphus which returns an internal Emacs. Should also
prompt for emacs executable (with versions!), selector.
