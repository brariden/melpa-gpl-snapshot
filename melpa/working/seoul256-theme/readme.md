# Seoul256.el

This is a (WIP) Emacs port of [Junegunn's](https://github.com/junegunn) Seoul-colours inspired vim theme, seoul256.  Hopefully all equivalent syntax highlighting, and perhaps the light version, will also be included in the future.

# Emacs users

This is not on MELPA or any other package managers yet.  If you wish to use, simply copy this .el into your `custom-theme-directory`.

# Vim users

This is a very pleasant font to work with.  Thoroughly recommended.

JuneGunn also releases some fantastic plugins for Vim, including my plugin manager of choice, Plug.
