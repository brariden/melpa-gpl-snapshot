## Installation

The easiest way is to install it from [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) with 
`M-x package-install RET underwater-theme`. Otherwise, see the commentary in
`underwater-theme.el` for manual installation instructions.

## Usage

After installing it:

1. `M-x load-theme RET underwater`
2. Don't like it? Type `M-x disable-theme RET underwater` to restore your
   previous theme.

## Contributing

Please feel free to file an issue for more face definitions -- I'd like this
theme to be usable for the entire Emacs experience.
