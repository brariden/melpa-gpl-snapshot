# v1.0.2 (unreleased)

* Trigger completions after `::` or `.`.
* Compatibility with latest company
* Fixed an issue where TAGS from other projects were also completion
  candidates

# v1.0.1

No changes since v0.0.2.

This release was created to [work around an issue
where MELPA stable](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa/issues/3205)
had created a v1.0.0 from an early version of racer.el

# v0.0.2

Initial release. Includes:

* Code completion with company
* Jump to definition
* Eldoc

Early users who are using `racer-activate` or `racer-turn-on-eldoc`
should use `racer-mode` and `eldoc-mode` instead. The former have been
deprecated.
