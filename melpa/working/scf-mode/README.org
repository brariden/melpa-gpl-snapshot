* shorten-compilation-filename

** Purpose

Shorten file-names found in compilation type buffers (e.g. grep output).
Linking still works, only the directory is hidden.

This package is implemented as a minor-mode, /scf-mode/ (scf stands for
shorten-compilation-filename).  When the minor-mode is turned off, file-names
are restored.

** Installation

See library header.
