(* The following is ugly, and deserves some explanations:
      As can be seen above, when encountering packed modules we override the
      loadpath by the one used to create the pack.
      This means that if the cmt files haven't been moved, we have access to
      the cmt file of every unit included in the pack.
      However, we might not have access to any other cmt (e.g. if others
      paths in the loadpath reference only cmis of packs).
      (Note that if we had access to other cmts, there might be conflicts,
      and the paths order would matter unless we have reliable digests...)
      Assuming we are in such a situation, if we do not find something in our
      "erased" loadpath, it could mean that we are looking for a persistent
      unit, and that's why we restore the initial loadpath. *)
