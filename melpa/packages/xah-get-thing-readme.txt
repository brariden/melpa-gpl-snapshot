This package provides functions similar to `thing-at-point' of `thingatpt.el'.

The functions are:

xah-get-bounds-of-thing
xah-get-bounds-of-thing-or-region
xah-get-thing-at-point
xah-get-thing-at-cursor (deprecated)
xah-get-thing-or-selection (deprecated)

They get “thing” independent of syntax table, so you always get same thing regardless what's current major mode.

Call describe-function on them to read the inline doc.
