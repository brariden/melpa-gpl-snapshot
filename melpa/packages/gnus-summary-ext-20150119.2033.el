;;
;; This library provides extra limit commands for filtering the gnus summary buffer,
;; some commands for performing actions on MIME parts in articles, and some general
;; functions for evaluating elisp code in marked articles.

;; You can apply complex filters for filtering the messages displayed in the *Summary* buffer
;; using `gnus-summary-ext-limit-filter', and you can save these filters in `gnus-summary-ext-saved-filters'.

;; See the documentation of the individual commands & functions for more
;; details.
;;;;

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-limit-to-mime-type'
;;    Limit the summary buffer to articles containing MIME parts with types matching REGEX.
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-limit-to-num-parts'
;;    Limit the summary buffer to articles containing between MIN & MAX attachments.
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-limit-to-size'
;;    Limit the summary buffer to articles of size between MIN and MAX bytes.
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-limit-to-filename'
;;    Limit the summary buffer to articles containing attachments with names matching REGEX.
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-limit-filter'
;;    Limit the summary buffer to articles which match filter expression.
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-apply-to-marked-safely'
;;    Evaluate any lisp expression for all articles that are process/prefixed.
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-apply-to-marked'
;;    Evaluate any lisp expression for all articles that are process/prefixed.
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-act-on-parts-in-marked'
;;    Do something with all MIME parts in articles that are process/prefixed.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `gnus-summary-ext-saved-filters'
;;    An alist of named filters that can be used with `gnus-summary-ext-limit-filter'.
;;    default = nil

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put gnus-summary-ext.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'gnus-summary-ext)


;;; Change log:

;; NOTE: for debugging you can use (gnus-summary-article-number) to get the article number of the
;; article on the current line of the *Summary* mode buffer.

(defun gnus-summary-ext-limit-filter (expr)
  "Limit the summary buffer to articles which match EXPR.
EXPR can be any elisp form to be eval'ed for each article which returns non-nil for required articles.
It can utilize named filters stored in `gnus-summary-ext-saved-filters' (which should be surrounded
in parentheses, e.g: (filter)), and any of the following functions:

 (subject REGEXP) : matches articles with subject field matching REGEXP
 (from REGEXP) : matches articles with from field matching REGEXP 
 (to REGEXP) : matches articles with To: field matching REGEXP
 (cc REGEXP) : matches articles with Cc: field matching REGEXP
 (recipient REGEXP) : matches articles with To: or Cc: field matching REGEXP
 (address REGEXP) : matches articles with To:, Cc: or From: field matching REGEXP
 (read) : matches articles that have been read
 (unread) : matches articles that haven't yet been read (equivalent to (not (read)))
 (replied) : matches articles which have been replied to 
 (unreplied) : matches articles which haven't been replied to (equivalent to (not (replied)))
 (age DAYS) : matches articles received before/after DAYS days ago (see `gnus-summary-limit-to-age')
 (agebetween MIN MAX) : matches articles received between MIN and MAX days ago.
 (marks STR) : matches articles with marks in STR (see `gnus-summary-limit-to-marks')

The following functions can also be used but will be much slower since they are evaluated after selecting
each article:

 (pred FUNC)     : matches articles for which function FUNC returns non-nil after selecting the article
 (content REGEXP)  : matches articles containing text that matches REGEXP 
 (header HD REGEXP) : matches articles with headers matching HD (a regular expression), whose values match REGEXP
 (filename REGEXP) : matches articles containing file attachments whose names match REGEXP
 (mimetype REGEXP) : matches articles containing mime parts with type names matching REGEXP
 (numparts MIN MAX) : matches articles with between MIN and MAX parts/attachments (inclusive).
                      Note: html and embedded images count as parts, and often there are several of these in an article.
 (size MIN MAX) : matches articles of approximate size between MIN & MAX bytes. 
                  If MAX is omitted then just check if size is bigger than MIN bytes

For example, to limit to messages received within the last week, either from alice or sent to bob:
  (gnus-summary-ext-limit-filter '(and (age -7) (or (from \"alice\") (to \"bob\"))))

To limit to unreplied messages that are matched by either of the saved filters 'work' or 'friends':
  (gnus-summary-ext-limit-filter '(and (unreplied) (or (work) (friends))))

(defun gnus-summary-ext-extract-text (&rest regions)
  "Extract text regions/rectangles from current buffer, and return them in a list.
Each argument defines a region or rectangle and should be either a regexp containing a grouping construct
 (e.g. \"Phone number: \\([0-9]+\\)\") matching text to be extracted, or a list of upto 5 elements in the
following order:

 1) A position (number) or a regexp indicating the start position of the region/rectangle
 2) A position (number) or a regexp indicating the end position of the region/rectangle
 3) Optional element - if non-nil then start at the beginning of the regexp match supplied in 1)
    (default is to start at the end of the match)
 4) Optional element - if non-nil then end at the beginning of the regexp match supplied in 2)
    (default is to end at the end of the match)
 5) Optional element - if non-nil then 1 & 2 define a rectangle, otherwise they define a region (default)

If a regexp is supplied for 1) or 2) and it contains a grouping construct then the first (non-shy) grouping construct
will be used to define the start/end positions instead of the whole regexp (thus allowing you to add some context to
matches).

Some examples:
  \"Phone number: \\\\([0-9]+\\\\)\" = matches the first number following \"Phone number: \"
  '(100 200) = matches the text between positions 100 and 200
  '(\"Shipping address\" \"Phone number: +\" t nil t) = matches the rectangle defined between the start of
                                                        \"Shipping address\" and the end of \"Phone number: +\"

The regions/rectangles will be extracted in order, and for regexp matches `re-search-forward' will be used from
the point at which the previous match ended. This means that you need to ensure that function arguments containing
regexp's are in the correct order.

The return value will be a list of strings and rectangles (lists of strings) corresponding to the arguments supplied
 (in the same order)."
