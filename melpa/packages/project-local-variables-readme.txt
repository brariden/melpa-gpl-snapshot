This file allows you to create .emacs-project files that are
evaluated when a file is opened. You may also create
.emacs-project-$MODE files that only get loaded when you open files
of a specific mode in the project. All files for which a
.emacs-project file exists in an ancestor directory will have it
loaded.

It has not been tested in versions of Emacs prior to 22.
