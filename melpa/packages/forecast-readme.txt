forecast.el generates  a _weather forecast report_  and displays it
in a  buffer.  It uses data  from Forecast.io (http://forecast.io),
and thus one needs to acquire an  api key from them in order to use
this package.  They  allow 1000 requests a day in  their free plan,
which should be enough for any user.

See Installation section for installation and setup instructions.

Installation:

See also «Example configuration».

forecast.el is available on Melpa with the package name `forecast'.

Otherwise, put  the forecast.el file  somewhere in your  path, then
`require' it.  Then set these variables in your configuration:

`forecast-latitude'  Latitude of your location,       float
`forecast-longitude' Longitude of your configuration  float
`forecast-city'      The name of your city            string
`forecast-country'   The name of your country         string
`forecast-api-key'   The API key from Forecast.io     string
`forecast-language'  Language to use                  symbol
`forecast-units'     Unit standard to use             symbol

Only the first  five variables are mandatory.  The  first four have
non-sane  defaults, and  if `forecast-api-key'  is absent,  program
will not run.

The variables  `forecast-city' and `forecast-country' are  used for
display  purposes only.  At  the moment  forecast.el cannot  deduce
these names  from the latitude  and longitude values, but  maybe in
future it will be able to.

The first two  variables default to 0.0. The  following two default
to "nil".

The API key  can be obtained via registering  oneself through their
developer website:

https://developer.forecast.io/

For the rest of variables, see their docstrings (C-h v RET var-name
RET).

See also  the docstring  for the face  `forecast-moon-phase', which
governs the face for the moon phase visualisation.  Most fonts will
not have  defined the  necessary characters, thus  one may  need to
install a special font, e.g. Quivira (http://quivira-font.com/).

Then on,  you may run  the command  `forecast' to get  the forecast
buffer.  The forecast  buffer uses `org-level-*' faces,  so it will
look like  your org  files.  It is  called «*Weather  Forecast*».

Example configuration:

(require 'forecast)
(setq forecast-latitude 41.168602
      forecast-longitude 29.047024
      forecast-city "İstanbul"
      forecast-country "Türkiye"
      forecast-api-key "<deduced>")

Or, for the privacy of the API key:

(require 'forecast)
(setq forecast-latitude 41.168602
      forecast-longitude 29.047024
      forecast-city "İstanbul"
      forecast-country "Türkiye")

(load (locate-user-emacs-file "forecast-api-key.el"))

And in the file ~/.emacs.d/forecast-api-key.el:

(setq forecast-api-key "<deduced>")
