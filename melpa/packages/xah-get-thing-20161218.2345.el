;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides functions similar to `thing-at-point' of `thingatpt.el'.

;; The functions are:

;; xah-get-bounds-of-thing
;; xah-get-bounds-of-thing-or-region
;; xah-get-thing-at-point
;; xah-get-thing-at-cursor (deprecated)
;; xah-get-thing-or-selection (deprecated)

;; They get “thing” independent of syntax table, so you always get same thing regardless what's current major mode.

;; Call describe-function on them to read the inline doc.

;;; HISTORY

;; 2015-05-22 changes won't be logged here anymore, unless incompatible ones.
;; version 1.0, 2015-05-22 was {unit-at-cursor, get-selection-or-unit} from xeu_elisp_util.el


;;; Code:

(defun xah-get-bounds-of-thing (*unit )
  "Return the boundary of *UNIT under cursor.

Return a cons cell (START . END).

*UNIT can be:

• 'word — sequence of 0 to 9, A to Z, a to z, and hyphen.

• 'glyphs — sequence of visible glyphs. Useful for file name, URL, …, anything doesn't have white spaces in it.

• 'line — delimited by “\\n”. (captured text does not include “\\n”.)

• 'block — delimited by empty lines or beginning/end of buffer. Lines with just spaces or tabs are also considered empty line. (captured text does not include a ending “\\n”.)

• 'buffer — whole buffer. (respects `narrow-to-region')

• 'filepath — delimited by chars that's USUALLY not part of filepath.

• 'url — delimited by chars that's USUALLY not part of URL.

• a vector [beginRegex endRegex] — The elements are regex strings used to determine the beginning/end of boundary chars. They are passed to `skip-chars-backward' and `skip-chars-forward'. For example, if you want paren as delimiter, use [\"^(\" \"^)\"]

This function is similar to `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.
The main difference are:

• This function's behavior does not depend on syntax table. e.g. for *units 「'word」, 「'block」, etc.

• 'line always returns the line without end of line character, avoiding inconsistency when the line is at end of buffer.

• Support certain “thing” such as 'glyphs that's a sequence of chars. Useful as file path or url in html links, but do not know which before hand.

• Some “thing” such 'url and 'filepath considers strings that at USUALLY used for such. The algorithm that determines this is different from thing-at-point.
