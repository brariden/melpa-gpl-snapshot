;;; Commentary:

;; `per-buffer-theme.el' is an Emacs library that automatically changes
;; the global theme according to buffer name or major mode.
;;
;; It runs through `window-configuration-change-hook' so it is not perfect.
;;
;; If buffer name matches any of `per-buffer-theme/ignored-buffernames-regex'
;; no theme change occurs.
;;
;; Customizable variable `per-buffer-theme/themes-alist' contains the
;; association between themes and buffer name or major modes.
;;
;; Special `notheme' theme can be used to make unload all themes and use emacs
;; default theme.
;;
;; If no theme matches then it'll load the theme stored in
;; `per-buffer-theme/default-theme'.

;;; Updates:

;; 2015/04/12 Initial version.
;; 2015/04/13 Changed `per-buffer-theme/theme-list' data type from plist
;;            to alist to make customization easier.
;;            Make code comply with (some) Emacs Lisp Code Conventions:
;;            - added public function to unload hook
;; 2015/09/25 Use advice function instead of hooks, it's more robust.
;; 2015/10/13 As themes are cumulative, remove previous theme definitions
;;            before applying new one
