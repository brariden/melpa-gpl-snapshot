Highlight TODO keywords in comments and strings.  There are
many modes like it but this one is mine.  It also happens to
be simpler than the following alternatives:

- [[http://emacswiki.org/fic-ext-mode.el][fic-ext-mode]]
- [[https://github.com/lewang/fic-mode][fic-mode]]
- [[http://emacswiki.org/FixmeMode][fixme-mode]]
- [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/fixmee][fixmee]]

See [[http://emacswiki.org/FixmeMode][this list]] on the Emacswiki for even more alternatives.

If you like this you might also like [[https://github.com/tarsius/orglink][orglink]], if you used
this, then the above links would not look so ugly.
