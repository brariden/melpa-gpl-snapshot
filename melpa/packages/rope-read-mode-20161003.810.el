;;; Commentary:

;; ** About rope-read

;; *** What

;; =rope-read-mode= can reverse every other line of a buffer or in a part
;; of a buffer.

;; With every other line reversed reading can be like following a rope.

;; *** Illustration

;; [[file:rope-read-illustration.png][file:./rope-read-illustration.png]]

;; *** Ad

;; - Are you tired moving the look from one end of a line to the other
;;   end just because of a line break?

;; - Are you too lazy moving the look from one end of a line to the
;;   other end just because of a line break?

;; - Do you think about the line break coercing the brutal change of the
;;   look from one side to the other as humiliating?

;; - Do you want to read three or four lines more of a text before you
;;   fall asleep?

;; More than zero yes answers?

;; Then rope read might help!

;; *** Why

;; - Chill.  =rope-read-mode= allows fluent reading.

;;   - Find the start of the next line easily.

;;   - Avoid stressful eye movement.

;; - Have an alternative view on text.

;; *** Learn

;; Typically you need to practice for some time to be able to read
;; upside-down lines effortlessly.

;; ** Usage

;; *** Turning it on and off

;; =M-x rope-read-mode= in a buffer activates rope-read.  No visible
;; change in the buffer is to be expected.  The buffer is set read-only.

;; Type =M-x rope-read-mode= or press 'q' to quit rope-read.  The buffer
;; writability gets restored.

;; *** Action

;; When =rope-read-mode= is on you can press
;; - =C-g= to interrupt =rope-read-mode= anytime
;; - =q= to quit =rope-read-mode=
;; - =?= to open the help buffer
;; - =r= /redraw standard/ to go back to the representation of the buffer
;;   without reversed lines (keeping =rope-read-mode=)
;; - =p= /paragraph/ to reverse every other line starting with the line
;;   below the cursor up to the end of the paragraph (if visible) and
;;   move point there
;; - The next four commands are each followed by reversing every other
;;   line in the visible part.  The keys are taken the same as in
;;   =view-mode=:
;;   - =SPC= to scroll a screen down
;;   - =<backspace>= or =S-SPC= to scroll a screen up
;;   - =v= or =<return>= to scroll one line down
;;   - =V= or =y= to scroll one line up
;; - =g= /get the rope-read/ to trigger reversing every other line for
;;   the currently visible part of the buffer
;; - =d= /downwards/ to reverse every other line starting with the line
;;   below the cursor

;; For convenience you can bind command =rope-read-mode= to a key.  For
;; example to activate or deactivate =rope-read-mode= by pressing scroll
;; lock two times use the line

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<Scroll_Lock> <Scroll_Lock>") 'rope-read-mode)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; *** Image files

;; The reverse representation of lines is realized with images.  They get
;; collected in directory =rope-read-image-overlay-path= which defaults
;; to =~/.emacs.d/rope-reading=.  You can delete this directory any time.

;; *** Security

;; =rope-read-mode= does not change the content of a buffer.  Data loss
;; has not been reported yet.

;; Since the overlay-image files get stored on disk this could be a
;; security issue.  E.g. when you use =rope-read-mode= to look at your
;; super secret password file.

;; *** Beep

;; The system beep can be annoying.  The line

;; #+BEGIN_SRC shell
;; amixer set Beep off
;; #+END_SRC

;; silences the beep on some systems.  Precondition is that you have the
;; ~amixer~ program ready.

;; *** User Feedback

;; [2016-10-03 Mon 15:04] M: "I use rope read mode occasionally to read
;; info manuals, mail (via gnus) and text of web pages (via eww).  Most
;; of the time I start the mode and then use key 'p' to walk through the
;; text.  Finally I use key 'q' to quit."

;; ** Install

;; *** Emacs Package

;; =rope-read-mode= is available as MELPA package
;; [[http://melpa.org/#/rope-read-mode][file:http://melpa.org/packages/rope-read-mode-badge.svg]] and ready
;; immediately after the install.

;; *** Install from el file

;; If you just have the emacs-lisp file then:
;; - load the file into Emacs
;; - do =M-x eval-buffer=

;; That's it.  You installed rope-read-mode and =M-x rope-read-mode= is
;; available.

;; ** Dependencies

;; - Emacs is running under X.
;; - The programm =convert= of the ImageMagick-suite is available.

;; The =convert= program has the job to create images of lines and rotate
;; them.

;; ** Development

;; *** Known Bugs

;; - rope-read-mode sometimes spontaneously fails.
;;   - In this case a refresh with =g= might help.
;;   - You can always try =C-g q= and start again.
;; - rope-read-mode often does not work for org-mode files.
;;   - Possibly this is due to the interference of overlays of org and
;;     rope-read.

;; *** Wishes

;; - Quicker transformation.

;; *** Vision

;; =rope-read-mode= gets =rope-mode= which allows also editing.
;; =rope-mode= would provide a further editing feeling maybe.

;; *** Lentic Literate Style

;; This program is written in emacs lisp in lentic style based on the
;; 'lentic' package [[http://melpa.org/#/lentic][file:http://melpa.org/packages/lentic-badge.svg]].

;; This means the that this file can be regarded just as an emacs lisp
;; file.  But actually this file contains extra comments which allow the
;; interpretation of the file as Org file.  Lentic-mode makes it easy to
;; write this style.

;; A possible initialization of lentic is this:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (global-lentic-start-mode)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; Find more about lentic at
;; [[http://melpa.org/#/lentic][file:http://melpa.org/packages/lentic-badge.svg]].

;; *** Communication

;; Use the GitHub infrastructure i.e. pull requests or
;; https://github.com/marcowahl/rope-read-mode/issues.  Or contact the
;; author directly.

;; *** Contribution

;; Contributions in any respect are welcome, e.g. ideas and improvements.
