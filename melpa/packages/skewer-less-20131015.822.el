;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode allowing LESS stylesheet manipulation via `skewer-mode'.

;; Note that this is intended for use in place of `skewer-css-mode',
;; which does not work with lesscss.

;; Enable `skewer-less-mode' in a ".less" buffer. Save the buffer to
;; trigger an update, or hit "C-c C-k" just like in
;; `skewer-css-mode'.

;; Operates by invoking "less.refresh()" via skewer on demand, or
;; whenever the buffer is saved.

;; For this to work properly, the less javascript should be included
;; in the target web page, and less should be configured in
;; development mode, e.g.

;;    <script>
;;      var less = {env: "development"};
;;    </script>
;;    <link href="/stylesheets/application.less" rel="stylesheet/less">
;;    <script src="/path/to/less.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

;; I may consider providing an option to instead run "lessc" from
;; Emacs, then send the output via skewer-css. Let me know if you want this.

;;; Code:

(require 'skewer-mode)

(defvar skewer-less-mode-map
  (let ((m (make-sparse-keymap)))
    ;; for consistency with skewer-css
    (define-key m (kbd "C-c C-k") 'skewer-less-save-and-reload)
    m)
  "Keymap for `skewer-less-mode'.")
