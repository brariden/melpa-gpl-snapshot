Speck is a minor mode for "specking" - spell-checking text displayed
in Emacs windows.  Invoke the command `speck-mode' to toggle specking
of all windows showing the current buffer.

    Add support to allow binding a lisp function to a "replace key" in
    `speck-replace-keys' and/or `speck-replace-map', so that one can define a
    function to do more hacking. For instance, one can define a function, and
    bind it to the ESC key in `speck-replace-keys' and/or
    `speck-replace-map', to decide whether to accept the speck correction, by
    returning non-nil, or reject it, by returning nil. One use case is that
    in Evil, a Vim emulation in Emacs, one can allow ESC to accept a speck
    correction only in insert state.
