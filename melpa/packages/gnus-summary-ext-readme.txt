This library provides extra limit commands for filtering the gnus summary buffer,
some commands for performing actions on MIME parts in articles, and some general
functions for evaluating elisp code in marked articles.

You can apply complex filters for filtering the messages displayed in the *Summary* buffer
using `gnus-summary-ext-limit-filter', and you can save these filters in `gnus-summary-ext-saved-filters'.

See the documentation of the individual commands & functions for more
details.
