This file provides syntax highlighting and utility methods for Fvwm
configuration files. Use the menu bar or C-h m to see what is available.

Thanks to Scott Andrew Borton for his excellent major mode
 tutorial, to Thomas Adam for providing his vim syntax file for
 Fvwm which was a great help in creating this mode and many others
 in the Emacs and Fvwm communities.

Thanks also to Hun from #fvwm for testing, bugreporting and
providing patches with added keywords.
