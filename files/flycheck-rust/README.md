flycheck-rust â€” Flycheck for Rust
=================================

[![License GPL 3][badge-license]][copying]

Configure [Flycheck][] for Rust.

- Setup Flycheck to follow the Cargo project layout.

Installation
------------

As usual, from [MELPA][] or [MELPA Stable][].

In your [`Cask`][cask] file:

```cl
(source gnu)
(source melpa)

(depends-on "flycheck-rust")
```

In your `init.el`:

```cl
(add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-rust-setup)
```

Usage
-----

Just use Flycheck as usual in your Rust/Cargo projects.

**Note:** You must run `cargo build` initially to install all dependencies.  If
you add new dependencies to `Cargo.toml` you need to run `cargo build` again.
Otherwise you will see spurious errors about missing crates.
