# occidental-theme.el for Emacs

This is a medium-contrast colour theme derived from the built-in
Adwaita theme in Emacs 24. The background colour has been changed
from white to yellow-ish and there are small tweaks here and there.

The theme uses the `deftheme` functionality found in Emacs 23/24, but
the theme is only tested under Emacs 24.
