Twig mode for emacs
===================

Major mode for editing twig files in emacs.
Forked from:

https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/jinja2-mode

Note
------------

Note that this is a very early version, I mostly took the aforementioned jinja2-mode and basically just renamed it.
Seeing as how jinja2 and twig are so similar this is good enough for a start.

Installation
------------

Put somewhere in load path and require it, it takes care of associating with twig files automatically:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/twig-mode") ;; Replace with directory you installed in
    (require 'twig-mode)
