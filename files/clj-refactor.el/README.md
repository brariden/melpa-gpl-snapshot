# clj-refactor.el

`clj-refactor` provides refactoring support for clojure projects.

Here's a small teaser, helping you add a missing libspec:

![](examples/add-missing-libspec.gif)

## Installation

I highly recommend installing clj-refactor through elpa.

It's available on [melpa](http://melpa.org/) and [melpa-stable](http://stable.melpa.org/):

    M-x package-install clj-refactor

## Setup

```el
(require 'clj-refactor)

(defun my-clojure-mode-hook ()
    (clj-refactor-mode 1)
    (yas-minor-mode 1) ; for adding require/use/import statements
    ;; This choice of keybinding leaves cider-macroexpand-1 unbound
    (cljr-add-keybindings-with-prefix "C-c C-m"))

(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'my-clojure-mode-hook)
```

The more advanced refactorings require our nREPL middleware [refactor-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl).

To install it add the following, either in your project's `project.clj` or in the `:user`
profile found at `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
:plugins [[refactor-nrepl "1.1.0"]
          [cider/cider-nrepl "0.9.1"]]
```

That's it!

Check out the much longer [installation](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/installation) page in the wiki for a less opinionated approach.

cljr-refactor has quite a few settings you can tweak to change the
behavior of various commands.  You can read more about that
[here](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki#customization).

### In case `refactor-nrepl` used for advanced refactorings

The [analyzer](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer) `refactor-nrepl` uses needs to eval the code too in order to be able to build the AST we can work with. If that causes side effects like writing files, opening connections to servers, modifying databases, etc. performing certain refactoring functions on your code will do that, too.

By default the user is warned about this when an AST dependent feature is invoked. If this warning is an annoyance and the project can be evalled without any risks set `cljr-warn-on-analyzer-needs-eval` to nil so `cljr-eagerly-build-asts-on-startup` can take effect.

We create ASTs for all the namespaces at REPL start up if `cljr-warn-on-analyzer-needs-eval` is set to nil. If that is not desired set `cljr-eagerly-build-asts-on-startup` to `nil` in your emacs configuration. AST dependent features at the moment are `find usages`, `rename symbol`, `extract function`, `inline symbol`, `rename file or dir`, `change function signature`, `promote function`.

## Usage

All functions in clj-refactor have a two-letter mnemonic shortcut. E.g. `rs` for `cljr-rename-symbol`.  Given the prefix choice in the example setup you'd call this function by hitting `C-c C-m rs`

See the wiki for a complete [list of available refactorings] (https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki), demonstrations and customization points.

If you're having trouble remembering the mnenmic shortcuts, check out
the [hydra](https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra) powered popup menus.
They are described
[here](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/hydra-parent).

## Changelog

An extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## Contribute

Yes, please do. There's a suite of tests, so remember to add tests for
your specific feature, or we might break it later.

You'll find the repo at:

    https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el

To fetch the test dependencies, install
[cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) if you haven't already,
then:

    $ cd /path/to/clj-refactor
    $ cask
