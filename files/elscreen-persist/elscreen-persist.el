;;; Commentary:

;; This makes elscreen persistent.
;;
;; To use this, use customize to turn on `elscreen-persist-mode`
;; or add the following line somewhere in your init file:
;;
;;     (elscreen-persist-mode 1)
;;
;; Or manually, use `elscreen-persist-store` to store,
;; and use `elscreen-persist-restore` to restore.
;;
;; Or manually, use `elscreen-persist-get-data` to get data to store,
;; and use `elscreen-persist-set-data` to set data to restore.
;;
;; Please see README.md from the same repository for documentation.
