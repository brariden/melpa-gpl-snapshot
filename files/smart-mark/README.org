* smart-mark [[http://melpa.org/#/smart-mark][file:http://melpa.org/packages/smart-mark-badge.svg]]

smart-mark restores cursor position after mark.
smart-mark-mode is a global minor mode.

For example:
#+begin_src
buffer line 1
buffer line 2 cursor is | here
buffer line 3
buffer line 4
#+end_src

when `smart-mark-mode` is active and you `mark-whole-buffer`,
#+begin_src
| buffer line 1
buffer line 2
buffer line 3
buffer line 4
#+end_src

the cursor moves to the beginning of the buffer, and you lose the cursor position,

with smart-mark, just press C-g, and the point restore back just where it was.
