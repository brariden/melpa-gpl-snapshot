;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a anything command for stream lists
;; which are defined or installed by each emms streams package.
;;
;; If `anything' is installed,
;; `emms-streams-jp-radios-anything' is available.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;; (require 'emms-streams-jp-radios-anything)
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Some stream lists need to update cache.
;; M-x `emms-streams-jp-radios-anything' TAB (Actions)
;; provides updating cache asynchronously.
;;
;; If you need an `anything' command for specific stream lists,
;; `emms-stream-onsen-anything' can be defined as bellow.
;;
;; e.g. 音泉
;; (defvar emms-stream-onsen-anything-c-source
;;   `((name . "EMMS Streams 音泉")
;;    (candidates . (lambda ()
;;                    (emms-stream-jp-radios-anything-combine
;;                     '(emms-stream-onsen-get-stream-list))))
;;    (action . ,emms-stream-jp-radios-anything-action-list)
;;    (migemo)
;;    (candidate-number-limit . 9999)))
;;
;; (defun emms-stream-onsen-anything ()
;;   "`anything' for emms streams onsen."
;;   (interactive)
;;   (anything :sources '(emms-stream-onsen-anything-c-source)
;;             :buffer "*Anything EMMS Streams 音泉*"))
;;
;; Note: This package is not compiled to be installed from MELPA.
;;
;; An error might occure when some candidates are marked and `anything-select-action' is used.
;; The following workaround would work.
;;
;; (defun anything-revive-visible-mark ()
;;   "Restore marked candidates when anything update display."
;;   (with-current-buffer anything-buffer
;;     (dolist (o anything-visible-mark-overlays)
;;       (goto-char (point-min))
;;       (while (and (search-forward (overlay-get o 'string) nil t)
;;                   (anything-current-source-name= (overlay-get o 'source)))
;;         ;; Calculate real value of candidate.
;;         ;; It can be nil if candidate have only a display value.
;;         (let ((real (get-text-property (point-at-bol 0) 'anything-realvalue)))
;;           (if real
;;               ;; Check if real value of current candidate is the same
;;               ;; that the one stored in overlay.
;;               (and (equal (overlay-get o 'real) real) ; * workaround using `equal'
;;                    (move-overlay o (point-at-bol 0) (1+ (point-at-eol 0))))
;;               (move-overlay o (point-at-bol 0) (1+ (point-at-eol 0)))))))))
