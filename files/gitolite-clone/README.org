[[http://melpa.org/#/gitolite-clone][file:http://melpa.org/packages/gitolite-clone-badge.svg]]

gitolite-clone provides a cached completing read of the repositories available on a gitolite server and the ability to set rules for how repositories should be cloned.

* Installation

Install from MELPA with ~M-x package-install gitolite-clone~. See the [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa][melpa repository]] for details about how to set up MELPA if you have not already done so.
* Setup
Setup for gitolite-clone is pretty simple. All you really need to do is specify the gitolite host you would like to use:

#+NAME: setup
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'gitolite-clone)
  (setq gitolite-clone:host "my.gitolite.host")
#+END_SRC

There are a bunch of other variables that you can customize -- they are all pretty self-explanatory, but I will try to get around to documenting them soon.
* Usage
``M-x gitolite-clone`` is pretty much all there is to it. If you haven't yet obtained the list of repos from your gitolite server this could take a bit. gitolite-clone uses [[https://github.com/sigma/pcache][pcache]] to cache results from the gitolite server (on a per server basis). gitolite-clone uses a default ttl of 3 days. Keep in mind that this means that new repositories usually won't appear immediately unless you force a refresh of the cache.
