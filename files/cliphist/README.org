* Install
The easiest way is install from [[http://melpa.org][melpa]] using package manager.

If you install from source code, please place cliphist.el somewhere (say ~/.emacs/lisp), and insert below code into ".emacs":

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'cliphist)
#+end_src

* Usage
Make sure the clipboard manager is running.

- `M-x cliphist-paste-item' to paste item from history
- `M-x cliphist-select-item' to select item

In popup, press `C-n' or `C-p' to navigate, other keys to filter.
* Advanced Tips (OPTIONAL)
You can customize the behavior of cliphist-select-item,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq cliphist-select-item-callback
      (lambda (num str) (cliphist-copy-to-clipboard str)))
#+end_src
