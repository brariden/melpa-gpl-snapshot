 CleverCSS Emacs Mode
======================

This is a Emacs major mode for editing CleverCSS files.  It provides
smart indentation, syntax highlighting and basic text manipulation
commands.  Much of the indentation functionality is copied from
`python.el`.

Installation
============

- Put `clevercss.el` somewhere in your emacs load path.
- Add these lines to your .emacs file:

    (autoload 'clevercss-mode "clevercss" nil t)
    
    (add-to-list auto-mode-alist '("\\.pcss\\'" . clevercss-mode))
 
This assumes that CleverCSS files have the suffix `.pcss`.  You may
use different suffixes by adding them to `auto-mode-alist`.  For
example, to use the suffix `.ccss` you would write the following in
your .emacs file:

    (add-to-list auto-mode-alist '("\\.ccss\\'" . clevercss-mode))

To customize how `clevercss-mode` works:

    M-x customize-group RET clevercss-mode RET

If you find bugs, patches are welcome.
