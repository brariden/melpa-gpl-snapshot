* 0blayout-mode -- Small Layout Management mode
This mode provides the ability to have several layouts saved and then you can
easily switch between your saved layouts. When you first load the mode, you will
get a "default" layout named "default".

** Default Prefix
Default keyboard prefix is ~C-c C-l~, and you can modify that by putting this
in your init-file (with your own prefix of course):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(0blayout-add-keybindings-with-prefix "C-c C-l")
#+END_SRC

** Usage
You have the ability to create new layouts using ~PREFIX C-c~ and name them.
There you can set up your layout as you want it, open buffers, edit files.

And when you have more than one layout, you can switch between the layouts you
have active with ~PREFIX C-b~.

You can also kill the layout that you're currently visiting with ~PREFIX C-k~.

** Install
*** Using MELPA
 - Follow the guide here http://melpa.org/#/getting-started to add MELPA Repos.
 - Then you can install ~0blayout~ from MELPA in ~package-list-packages~

You could also have a clause like this to automaticly install it:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(unless (package-installed-p '0blayout)
  (progn
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install '0blayout)))
#+END_SRC

To activate ~0blayout-mode~ you just put ~(0blayout-mode 1)~ somewhere after you
loaded it.

*** Manual install
 - Download ~0blayout.el~
 - Put the file in some folder like ~$HOME/.emacs.d/lisp/~

Then you can include like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path
             (expand-file-name "lisp" user-emacs-directory))

(require '0blayout)

(0blayout-mode 1)                       ; Activate 0blayout-mode
#+END_SRC

** Things to do
 - Add name of current layout to the mode-line
 - Kill other layouts than the one you're visiting, also with tab-completions
 - Remove the ~C-c C-l C-c~ (create new layout) command and just support switch to a undefined buffer to create a new one.

** Name
0b is just a prefix I use for things because I have the domain 0b.se, that's it.
