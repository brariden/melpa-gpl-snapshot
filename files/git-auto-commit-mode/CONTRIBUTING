If you wish to contribute you can use either the sources located on
[[http://code.ryuslash.org/cgit.cgi/emacs/git-auto-commit-mode/][ryuslash.org]] or the [[https://github.com/ryuslash/git-auto-commit-mode][github]] sources.

* Getting the source

  If you wish to work on git-auto-commit-mode you can get the sources
  by cloning the repository:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    git clone git://ryuslash.org/emacs/git-auto-commit-mode.org
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Style

  Use spaces, don't use tabs. If you can, keep lines shorter than 80
  characters. Other than that, Emacs can handle indentation pretty
  well.

* Patches

  If you want to send any patches I prefer an email with the output
  generated by =git request-pull=, possibly with =-p=, over things like
  github pull requests.
