In order to use git-auto-commit-mode you need to make sure that it
can be found in your =load-path=. You can do this either by installing
it through ELPA or you can do it manually.

* ELPA

  git-auto-commit-mode can be found in both [[http://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] and [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]], so
  if you have either of those set-up installing should be as easy as:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    M-x package-install <RET> git-auto-commit-mode <RET>
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  And you're done.

* Manual

  To install git-auto-commit-mode manually you should download the
  sources from one of the several places it can be found, after which
  you should extract the archive and add the resulting directory to
  you load path:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/git-auto-commit-mode")
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Once it can be found in your =load-path= you can =load=, =require= or
  =autoload= it, whichever you like:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (require 'git-auto-commit-mode)

    ;; Or...

    (autoload 'git-auto-commit-mode "git-auto-commit-mode")
  #+END_EXAMPLE
