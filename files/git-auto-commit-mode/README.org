  push) a git repository.

* SYNOPSIS

  =M-x git-auto-commit-mode <RET>=

* DESCRIPTION

  git-auto-commit-mode is an Emacs minor mode that tries to commit
  changes to a file after every save.

  The commit message sent to git is always the filename of the file
  saved, relative to the root of the git repository.

* USAGE

  When enabled, git-auto-commit-mode uses the =after-save-hook= to
  commit changes to git each time. If =gac-automatically-push-p= is
  non-nil it also tries to push the ~HEAD~ to the current upstream.
  Making sure that upstream is properly set is the responsibility of
  the user.

** Enabling

   Since git-auto-commit-mode is a regular minor mode you have more
   than one option to enable it.

*** As a file-local variable

    If you're using Emacs 24 or newer you should set an =eval=
    file-local variable:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ;; -*- eval: (git-auto-commit-mode 1) -*-
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    If you're using an older version of Emacs, that should be:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ;; -*- mode: git-auto-commit -*-
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** As a directory-local variable

    If you're using Emacs 24 or newer you should set an =eval= variable:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ((nil . ((eval git-auto-commit-mode 1))))
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    If you're using an older version of Emacs, that should be:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ((nil . ((mode . git-auto-commit))))
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** As a hook

    To enable git-auto-commit-mode each time a ~certain-hook~ runs:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (add-hook 'certain-hook 'git-auto-commit-mode)
    #+END_EXAMPLE

* CUSTOMIZATION

  git-auto-commit-mode is a simple mode, as such it offers little
  customization.

  - =gac-automatically-push-p= :: A boolean value indicating whether or
       not git-auto-commit-mode should try to push the git
       repository's ~HEAD~ to its default upstream. Setting up the
       upstream is the user's responsibility.

  - gac-ask-for-summary-p :: A boolean value indicating whether or not
       git-auto-commit-mode should ask the user for a commit message
       every time a commit is made.
