;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Makes Emacs "pulse" your lisp forms when you eval them. This gives you a
;; clear visual indication that you have evaled something and, when evaling
;; subforms an indication of what you have evaled.

;; To enable this, add
;;
;; (require 'eval-pulse)
;;
;; to your .emacs, and enable it via a hook in all appropriate buffers.

;; To work this package advices `eval-buffer' and `eval-region', as these
;; functions are called directly from the menu system. Surely, it can't be a
;; good idea to change such low-level functions, a core part of the lisp
;; loading system of Emacs for such a piece of cheap eye-candy?

;;; Status:
;;
;; I use it all the time, but then I am easily impressed.
