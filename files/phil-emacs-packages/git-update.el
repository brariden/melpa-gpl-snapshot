;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package ensures that a git repository is cloned, and updates is
;; regularly. This is useful for using Emacs packages where you want to
;; stay on the bleeding edge. Think of it as a poor-mans MELPA or el-get.
;;
;; It has the advantage over el-get that it's pretty fast -- it's 100 lines
;; long rather than 1000's. Obviously, it's not as clever either. And it has
;; the advantage over package.el that it can be used unattended. I use it in
;; conjunction with `use-package' to maintain many of my external packages; I
;; maintain a single .emacs files which I synchronize between machines, with
;; the actual installation taking place automatically, as in this example:
;;
;; (use-package clojure-mode
;;   :init (git-update "git://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode.git"
;;            "~/emacs/packages/development")
;;   :mode ("\\.clj$" . clojure-mode)
;;   :defer t
;;   :config
;;   (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'clojure-test-maybe-enable)
;;
;; It has a single entry point `git-update' which takes a repo location and,
;; optionally a location in which to install. Adding to the load path takes
;; place automatically.
