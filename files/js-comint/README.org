* js-comint.el (v0.0.3)
Run a JavaScript interpreter in an inferior process window

The first release, [[http://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net/][js-cominit 0.0.1, is hosted on sourceforge]] but it has not
been updated in five years.

* Features
- Can select node.js versions using [[https://github.com/rejeep/nvm.el][nvm.el]]
- Use [[https://nodejs.org][node.js]] by default.
- When loading file, detect what API to be used automatically
- Based on js-comint hosted on http://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net/

* Installation
** Direct download of js-comint.el
Place the js-cominit.el somewhere say "~/mylisp/".

Insert below code to "~/.emacs.d/init.el",
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/mylisp/")
(require 'js-comint)
#+END_SRC

** Using [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][ELPA]]
Insert below code to "~/.emacs.d/init.el",
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'package)
(package-initialize)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-install 'js-comint)
(require 'js-comint)
#+END_SRC

** Using [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]]
Add js-comint to your Cask file:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(depends-on "js-comint")
#+END_SRC

* Usage
After installation, do `M-x run-js` to create a comint buffer with the JavaScript interpreter.

* Customization
You can set the `inferior-js-program-command' string and the `inferior-js-program-arguments' list to the executable that runs the JS interpreter and the arguments to pass to it respectively.

E.g., the default is:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq inferior-js-program-command "node")
(setq inferior-js-program-arguments '("--interactive"))
#+END_SRC

Note that in the example above, the version of node that is picked up will be the first found in `exec-path'.

But you could use Rhino or Spidermonkey or whatever you want.
E.g. to set up the Rhino JAR downloaded from https://github.com/mozilla/rhino, do

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq inferior-js-program-command "java")
(setq inferior-js-program-arguments '("-jar" "/absolute/path/to/rhino/js.jar"))
#+END_SRC

If you have nvm, you can select the versions of node.js installed and run them. This is done thanks to nvm.el.

To enable nvm support, run
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(js-do-use-nvm)
#+END_SRC

The first time you start the JS interpreter with run-js, you will be asked to select a version of node.js. If you want to change version of node js, run `(js-select-node-version)`

You can add the following couple of lines to your .emacs to take advantage of cool keybindings for sending things to the javascript interpreter inside of Steve Yegge's most excellent js2-mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'js2-mode-hook '(lambda ()
                            (local-set-key "\C-x\C-e" 'js-send-last-sexp)
                            (local-set-key "\C-\M-x" 'js-send-last-sexp-and-go)
                            (local-set-key "\C-cb" 'js-send-buffer)
                            (local-set-key "\C-c\C-b" 'js-send-buffer-and-go)
                            (local-set-key "\C-cl" 'js-load-file-and-go)))
#+END_SRC
