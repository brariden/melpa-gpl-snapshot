Clojure and Asciidoc Interaction
================================

This document shows the transformation between asciidoc and clojure, which is
a slightly more complex transformation that the usual block transform.
Source blocks are distinguish as follows:

[source,lisp]
----
(println "Hello")
----

In asciidoc, the "----" lines are actually optional for a single block, but
not for lentic where they are required.

[source,lisp]
----
(println "hello")
----

And finally, we finish with the local variables. In this case, the "main" file
is the asciidoc form, which we transform to Clojure.


//
// Local Variables:
// lentic-init: lentic-asciidoc-clojure-init
// End: 
//
