This is an "orgel" file. That is a valid emacs lisp file with comments in
org-mode. The header comments are translated into header one in org mode.

Now what hapens
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun orgel-function ())
#+end_src

And we finish off with the local variables declaration.

#+begin_src python
print("This is python")
#+end_src


# Local Variables:
# lentic-init: lentic-orgel-org-init
# End:
