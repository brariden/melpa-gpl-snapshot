#+TITLE: The Mandoku project
# #+DATE: 2011-06-17


* About Mandoku 
  Mandoku is a framework for supporting collaborative research on
  premodern Chinese texts. This includes the tasks of
  * Philologically establishing a text, possibly by referencing and
    collating multiple versions of a text, a digital facsimile and a
    text can be displayed side by side
  * Reading, annotating, analyzing and translating a text
  * Working with repositories of texts, compare, study and analyze
    differences among these texts
  * Establish and maintain metadata about such texts, for example
    concerning the dates, authors, place of creation etc. of the texts
  * Compare notes, share information with other researchers working on
    these texts
    
  To achieve all this, Mandoku defines a file format, directory
  layout, establishes text repositories and develops software to
  operate with these.
  Documentation of the Mandoku text format:

* Status
  

  [2011-06-17] The project has not yet been publically announced,
  because at the moment, there is not much to be seen here.  Once that
  changes, I will make an announcement and remove this silly notice.

  [2013-07-09] A built of Emacs 24.3 that allows the display of
  Unicode Ext. B characters can be found [[file:data/Emacs24.3+2013-07-03.dmg.zip][here]].

  [2013-09-26] [[file:mandoku-install-en.html][Installation instructions]] for a preview version are now available.

  [2014-01-13] [[file:mandoku-install-en.html][updated Installation instructions]] for a preview version.

  [2014-09-27] a new preview version is available, see
  [[file:mandoku-install-en.html][Installation instructions]]

  [2015-11-27] updated installation instructions and a new preview
  version available [[file:mandoku-install-en.html][Installation
  instructions]]:

* Software
  The software for using Mandoku texts falls in two broad categories:
  text processing software and a frontend to the user.  For both of
  these categories there are multiple possibilities, but not all of
  them will be realized right now.

  What is there at the moment is pre-alpha quality, not documented and
  full of quirks. It is made available as is as open source under a
  BSD-style license, see https://github.com/cwittern/mandoku.  Use it
  as you like and drop me a line if you are stuck.
  
** Interface software
*** Emacs
    A set of Emacs lisp files, that together form a working
    environment for comfortable dealing with the texts.  The advantage
    of using Emacs lies in the fact, that it can make use of the large
    amount of modules relevant for researchers.  These include for example
    * Bibliography management (org-bibtex, reftex)
    * Publication (org-exp, many conversion targets, including HTML,
      PDF, ODT, DocBook [TEI to come])
    * Task management (org-mode)
    * Dictionary lookup (lookup)

    Mandoku is thus standing on the shoulders of a giant, but by
    adding a few little pieces here and there, it becomes even more
    useful for specific tasks.

    
*** Web
    
    A web interface, mainly geared at casual users without the need to
    have the files locally, is under development, a first test version
    is currently in internal testing.

# *** PyQt based interface (maybe)
#     ** to be done **


    
** Text processing software
   Many tasks require operating in some way on the texts, for example
   extracting certain parts, comparing them with other, collate texts
   etc.  In the context of the Mandoku project, a special processing
   model has been developed to make these tasks possible.  Several
   programs and scripts have been developed for such tasks.
   
   Another set of scripts works with digital facsimiles, which have to
   be cleared up, cropped, deskewed, scaled, and cut in such a way
   that they can be presented alongside a transcribed text. 

   All these programs have been written in Python [[http://www.python.org/][(Python Programming
   Language - Official Website]]), these are available in the python directories.
