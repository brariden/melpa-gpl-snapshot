# ir-black-theme.el for Emacs 24's `deftheme`

A light-on-dark color theme adapted from Todd Werth's [original Textmate theme](http://toddwerth.com/2007/03/29/ir_black-the-last-textmate-theme-youll-ever-need/).

## Installation

The easiest way is to install it through [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/) with 
`M-x package-install RET ir-black-theme`. Otherwise, see the commentary in 
`ir-black-theme.el` for manual installation instructions.

## Usage

After installing it:

1. `M-x load-theme RET ir-black`
2. Don't like it? Type `M-x disable-theme RET ir-black` to restore your
   previous theme.

## Contributing

Please feel free to file an issue for more face definitions -- I'd like this
theme to be usable for the entire Emacs experience.
