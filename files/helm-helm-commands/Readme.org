This provides a single command `helm-helm-commands' which will present a helm buffer 
containing a list of helm commands and short descriptions. You can press C-z on an item
to see a longer description of the command, and RET to execute the command.

Note: you can achieve the same thing with the `helm-M-x' command which comes with helm, 
but that requires a few more keystrokes and doesn't show descriptions by default.
* Installation

 - If you have [[http://www.marmalade-repo.org/][marmalade-repo.org]], this helm-helm-commands is part of the emacs packages you can install.  
 - Just type M-x package-install helm-helm-commands marmalade 
 - Otherwise download the library from here Lisp:helm-helm-commands, and put it in a directory in the emacs load path, 
   (like ~/.emacs.d)
 - Add (require 'helm-helm-commands) in your ~/.emacs file
