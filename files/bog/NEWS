Bog NEWS -- history of user-visible changes         -*- mode: org; -*-

* v1.1.0

** New features

- New command ~bog-list-orphan-files~ finds citekey files that don't
  have a corresponding citekey heading in the notes.

- New command ~bog-rename-citekey-file~ updates the name of an
  existing citekey file.

- New option ~bog-combined-bib-ignore-not-found~ controls whether
  ~bog-create-combined-bib~ prompts to continue when a citekey's bib
  file is missing.  With a prefix argument to
  ~bog-create-combined-bib~, the meaning of this option is reversed.

** Other changes

- ~bog-search-notes~ and ~bog-search-notes-for-citekey~ now ignore any
  agenda restriction locks.

- In Dired, ~bog-create-combined-bib~ now always acts on the marked
  files (or, if there are none, the one at point) regardless of the
  prefix argument, which is no longer interpreted by
  ~dired-get-marked-files~.

* v1.0.0

** New features

- Any file type (not just PDFs) can now be associated with a citekey.
  Variables ~bog-pdf-directory~ and ~bog-pdf-file-name-separators~
  have been replaced by new variables ~bog-file-directory~ and
  ~bog-citekey-file-name-separators~, respectively.
  Unlike ~bog-pdf-file-name-separators~, the value of
  ~bog-citekey-file-name-separators~ is a regular expression, not a
  list.

- In addition to ~bog-find-citekey-file~ and ~bog-find-citekey-bib~,
  most functions will now prompt with set of citekeys when prefix
  argument is given.  What this list is depends on the function.

- When locating a citekey from the notes fails, functions will now
  prompt with a list of citekeys instead of giving an error.

- All Bog commands now work outside of Org buffers.  To access them,
  bind ~bog-command~ a global key.

- When Bog mode is turned on in non-Org buffers, text matching
  bog-citekey-format is now highlighted, without relying on
  Org-specific font-lock mechanisms.

- New command ~bog-citekey-tree-to-indirect-buffer~ opens the subtree
  for a citekey in an indirect buffer.  The citekey is either taken from
  at point or selected from all heading citekeys.

- New command ~bog-insert-heading-citekey~ prompts with all heading
  citekeys and inserts the selected one at point.

- New commands ~bog-open-citekey-link~ and
  ~bog-open-first-citekey-link~ open a link (or links) for a citekey.
  ~bog-open-first-citekey-link~ is particularly useful if you place
  the main link for the study (usually a DOI link) as the first link
  in the citekey's subtree.  The citekey is either taken from at point
  or selected from all heading citekeys.

- New commands ~bog-next-non-heading-citekey~ and
  ~bog-previous-non-heading-citekey~

- New command ~bog-list-orphan-citekeys~ finds citekeys that are
  referred to in the notes but don't have their own heading.

- ~bog-create-combined-bib~ now supports collecting citekeys from
  marked files in a Dired buffer.

- ~bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-notes~ now works when citekeys are
  stored are stored as property values.

- New command ~bog-list-duplicate-heading-citekeys~ finds citekeys
  that have more than one heading in the notes.

- New command ~bog-jump-to-topic-heading~ provides quick navigation to
  topic headings in any note file.

- New variable ~bog-subdirectory-group~ controls whether BibTeX and
  citekey-associated files are organized into subdirectories generated
  from a ~bog-citekey-format~ regexp group.

- New minor mode Bog View sets the buffer to read-only and provides
  single-letter key for bindings for many Bog commands.

** Other changes

- The command ~bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-buffer~ has been removed.
  Similar behavior is now available when a double C-u is used as the
  prefix argument to ~bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-notes~.

- ~bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-notes~ now widens the buffer if the
  heading is outside of the narrowed region.

- The format for citekeys is now restricted to letters, digits,
  underscores, and hyphens.

- ~bog-notes-directory~ has been renamed to ~bog-note-directory~.

- New variable ~bog-citekey-web-search-groups~ specifies which parts
  of the citekey are used for the search.

* v0.6.0

** New features

- Citekeys can now be stored as a property in addition to as a heading
  title.

- Make functions compatible with a single BibTeX file.
- Add new command ~bog-refile~.

- Multiple PDFs can be associated with a citekey.

- Add commands ~bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-buffer~ and
  ~bog-goto-citekey-heading-in-notes~.

- Make PDF file separator customizable.

- Add agenda search commands ~bog-search-notes~ and
  ~bog-search-notes-for-citekey~.

- Add commands ~bog-sort-topic-headings-in-buffer~ and
  ~bog-sort-topic-headings-in-notes~.

- Read a new name if renaming to PDF that exists (instead of giving an
  error).

- Allow numbers to be in the title word of citekey.

** Bugs fixed

- Fix a logic bug in citekey selection.

** Other changes

- In addition to renaming PDF files, use the stage for renaming and
  cleaning BibTeX files.

- Remove the path when presenting choices for renaming a PDF.

- Define a keymap and minor mode for Bog.
