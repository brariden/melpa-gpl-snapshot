* Introduction
  ess-R-data-view is data viewer for GNU R. It shows dataframe and matrix on table view.

* Usage 
  Put caret on a word that indicate dataframe or matrix, and  =M-x ess-R-dv-ctable= or =M-x ess-R-dv-pprint=.
  So, it popups other buffer containing table.

  If its word is not dataframe or matrix, popup error message.

  =ess-R-dv-ctable= and =ess-R-dv-pprint= have different features. 
  
  The first, =ess-R-dv-ctable= shows table in other buffer. It includes  border, and header is fixed.

  The second,  =ess-R-dv-pprint= shows pretty-printed text in other buffer. It shows huge text smoothly.

* Note
  ess-R-data-view uses other buffer, so it influences window layout. If you keep windows layout, you had better install window manager. popwin.el and e2wm.el is useful.
