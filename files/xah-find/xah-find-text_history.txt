;; version 1.6.7, 2013-06-17 • WARNING the argument for case search is reversed for xah-find-replace-text-regex. • added a case search option for xah-find-text-regex
;; version 1.6.6, 2012-12-16 Now, the backup file's suffix is same for all backup files created during one command call. Before, each backup file has timestamp when the backup file is created, that is, their seconds will differ.

;; version 1.6.4, 2012-12-06 Backup file name now has this format: 「~‹x›~‹datetimestamp›~」 where ‹x› is 「t」 for plain text replace and 「r」 for regex replace. e.g. 「x.html~r~20121206_095642~」 Also, modified the prompt for 「xah-find-replace-text-regex」 so it is consistent with the function's argument.
