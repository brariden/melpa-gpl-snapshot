* Commify
 Insert or remove grouping commas (or other grouping character) in a number
 under or adjacent to the cursor with a single command.  This is an otherwise
 tedious chore and one that is not easily done via a macro or other Emacs
 user-level facilities.

* Installation
** Without Package
Add commify.el to your load-path and
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'commify)
#+END_SRC

** With Package Manager
Simply install the ~commify~ package.

* Configuration
Commify has three variables that you can set to alter its behaviour, either
through the Emacs customize facility or with ~setq~'s in your init file.

- commify-group-char :: set this to a one-character string for inserting
     between groups of digits.  By default it is set to ",".
- commify-group-size :: set this to an integer specifying the number of
     characters you want in each group.  By default this is set to 3.
- commify-decimal-char :: set this to a one-character string that is used as a
     decimal point.  By default this is set to ".".

Bind the ~commify-toggle~ command to a convenient key.  I have put it on the
",," keychord since it is rare in English to type two commas in a row.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (key-chord-define-global ",," 'commify-toggle)
#+END_SRC

You may also want to change the default settings:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq commify-group-char "_")
  (setq commify-decimal-char ",")
  (setq commify-group-size 4)
  (key-chord-define-global ",," 'commify-toggle)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
When editing a buffer, simply put your cursor before, after, or within a
number, integer, or decimal, then invoke the command.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The factorial of 15 is 1307674368000.
#+END_QUOTE

With the cursor anywhere in or immediately adjacent to the number, hit ",,"
(or whatever you've bound the ~commify-toggle~ command to) and the buffer will
change to:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The factorial of 15 is 1,307,674,368,000.
#+END_QUOTE

If you invoke the command again, the commas are removed.  ~commify-toggle~
works on floating or scientific numbers as well, but it only ever affects the
digits before the decimal point as defined in the ~commify-decimal-char~
variable.

Afterwards, the cursor will be placed immediately after the affected number.

Not much to it, but it saves me a lot of time.
