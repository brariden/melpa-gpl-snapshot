Jump to Chinese characters using =ace-jump-mode= or =avy=.

UPDATE(2015-11-26): Now jumping to traditional Chinese characters is supported
by setting =ace-pinyin-simplified-chinese-only-p= to =nil=.

* Setup
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ace-pinyin.el")
  : (require 'ace-pinyin)

  Or install via [[http://melpa.org/#/ace-pinyin][melpa]].
* Usage
  By default this package is using =ace-jump-mode=. When using =ace-jump-mode=,
  the =ace-jump-char-mode= command can jump to Chinese characters. If you prefer
  =avy=, you can make =ace-pinyin= use =avy= by:
  : (setq ace-pinyin-use-avy t)

  When using =avy=, =avy-goto-char=, =avy-goto-char-2= and
  =avy-goto-char-in-line= are supported to jump to Chinese characters.

  Note =ace-pinyin-use-avy= variable should be set *BEFORE* you call
  =ace-pinyin-global-mode= or =turn-on-ace-pinyin-mode=.

  Example config to use =ace-pinyin= globally:
  : ;; (setq ace-pinyin-use-avy t) ;; uncomment if you want to use `avy'
  : (ace-pinyin-global-mode +1)

  If you want to turn on/off =ace-pinyin-mode= locally, don't directly call
  =ace-pinyin-mode=. Use =turn-on-ace-pinyin-mode= or =turn-off-ace-pinyin-mode=
  instead.

  When the minor mode is enabled, then =ace-jump-char-mode= (or =avy-goto-char=,
  depends on your config) will be able to jump to both Chinese and English
  characters. That is, you don't need remember an extra command or create extra
  key bindings in order to jump to Chinese character. Just enable the minor mode
  and use =ace-jump-char-mode= (or =avy-goto-char=) to jump to Chinese
  characters.

  Besides, all other packages using =ace-jump-char-mode= (or =avy-goto-char=)
  will also be able to jump to Chinese characters. For example, if you've
  installed [[https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap][ace-jump-zap]], it will also be able to zap to a Chinese character by
  the first letter of pinyin. Note =ace-jump-zap= is implemented by using
  =ace-jump-mode=, so you can't use =avy= in this case. You can check out my
  fork of =ace-jump-zap= using =avy=: [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/avy-zap][avy-zap]].
* Traditional Chinese Characters Support
  By default, =ace-pinyin= only supports simplified Chinese characters. You can
  make =ace-pinyin= aware of traditional Chinese characters by the following
  setting:
  : (setq ace-pinyin-simplified-chinese-only-p)

* Other available commands
** =ace-pinyin-dwim=
   If called with no prefix, it can jump to both Chinese characters and English
   letters. If called with prefix, it can only jump to Chinese characters.

** =ace-pinyin-jump-word=
   Using this command, you can jump to the start of a sequence of Chinese
   characters(/i.e./ Chinese word) by typing the sequence of the first letters
   of these character's pinyins. If called without prefix, this command will
   read user's input with a default timeout 1 second(You can customize the
   timeout value). If called with prefix, then it will read input from the
   minibuffer and starts search after you press "enter".

* Demo
  *WARNING*: The demo is a little out of date. You should use
  =ace-pinyin-global-mode= (globally) or =turn-on-ace-pinyin-mode= (locally)
  instead of =ace-pinyin-mode= to enable the minor mode!

  Enable =ace-pinyin-mode= and use =ace-jump-char-mode= to jump to Chinese
  characters:

  If you have installed [[https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap][ace-jump-zap]], then enabling =ace-pinyin-mode= will also
  make =ace-jump-zap-to-char= capable of handling Chinese characters.
