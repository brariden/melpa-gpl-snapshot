* TracWiki-Mode

** What is it?
tracwiki-mode is a major mode for working with [[http://trac.edgewall.org/][Trac]], a popular "open
source web-based project management and bugtracking system". I got
tired of working with it in the browser, and sat down and figured out
how to build a major mode.

** Who wrote it?
[[http://peawee.net][I did!]] However, large parts of it are inspired by / lifed from
[[http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/][Markdown Mode]].

** What's the license?
GPLv2.

** What's next?
The current path is to finish fleshing out the Trac syntax, and then
from there the goal is to work in xml-rpc integration so you don't
ever have to leave the world's best text editor just to browse
something as simple as a wiki ;)
