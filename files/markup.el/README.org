* Markup.el
** What is `markup.el`?
   `markup.el` is a library for Emacsen to easily generate markup code
   from lisp. Essentially itÂ´s an emacs lisp port of cl-markup (look
   at: https://github.com/arielnetworks/cl-markup)

** How to use it?



You can generate simple markup like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp   
  ;; simple example
  (markup (:p "This is a simple example")) ;; => "<p>This is a simple example</p>"
#+END_SRC

When you want to have a full document you can do something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp   
  (markup-html5
   (:div :style "border: 1px solid #000"
         "Some content of the div!"))
  ;; => "<!DOCTYPE html><html><div style=\"border: 1px solid #000\">Some content of the div!</div></html>"
#+END_SRC

You can even mix in some other expressions or variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp   
  (let ((maximum 5))
    (markup-html5
     (:body
      (:ul
       (loop for x from 1 to maximum
             collect
             (markup (:li  x " / " maximum)))))))
  ;; => "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><ul><li>1 / 5</li><li>2 / 5</li><li>3 / 5</li><li>4 / 5</li><li>5 / 5</li></ul></body></html>"
#+END_SRC
