# Diffscuss.vim: a Vim plugin for Diffscuss workflows

(This README describes the implementation of the plugin -- if you're looking
for usage information, see the top-level README file.)

This directory contains the Vim interface to Diffscuss. If you're looking to
hack on the Vim plugin, this is a good entry point, but note that the plugin
uses the Python code in ```support``` as a "backend" for moving within and
transforming Diffscuss files.
