#+TITLE: toggle-window

Toggle your current window between half frame height and full frame height.

* Why would I want this?

If you often work with a single horizontal split frame with one primary and
secondary window and want to hide the secondary window periodically to give your
primary more vertical real estate. I wrote this to hide my clojure REPL.

* Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'toggle-window)
    ;; Unfortunately it doesn't hide it 100%.
    ;; This hides it more than default settings.
    ;; You can set this value higher if you want the secondary window to shrink
    ;; less.
    (setq window-min-height 0)
    ;; Bind the function toggle-window-hide-show-window to something.
    ;; [f9] is an example. I personally use ,-h.
    (global-set-key [f9] 'toggle-window-hide-show-window)
#+end_src

* Usage

In the window you want to toggle between half-height and full-height, press
=[f9]= or whatever you decided you wanted your binding to be. Alternatively,
hit =M-x toggle-window-hide-show-window=.
