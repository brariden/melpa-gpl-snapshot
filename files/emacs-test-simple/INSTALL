This package is now installable from inside Emacs and melpa. 

We have an old-style GNU autoconf configuration as well and an install
script to pick that up from git sources. For this, you will need:

   * Emacs, of course. Version 23 or better
   * _autoconf_ and _autoreconf_ to build the configure script. Usually _autoreconf_ comes with an "autoconf" package
   * GNU Make -- or even better "remake":http//bashdb.sf.net/remake
  
If you are feeling lucky, you can try running the install script from the github repository:

    $ bash < <( curl https://raw.github.com/rocky/emacs-test-simple/master/install-from-git.sh )

Otherwise:

   git clone http://github.com/rocky/emacs-test-simple
   cd emacs-test-simple
   ./configure && make && [sudo] make install
