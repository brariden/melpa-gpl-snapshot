#+TITLE: never-comment README

* ABOUT

Often C programmers type blocks of code between =#if 0= and =#endif=.
This code will never be compiled. Therefore some IDE's display this code
as comment. With this module, emacs will also do this.

* INSTALLATION

Just put this file in your emacs =load-path= and place the following lines
somewhere in your =.emacs= init file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'never-comment)
(never-comment-init)
#+END_SRC

* DISCLAIMER
The code is actually written by Scott Frazer on [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/4554658/89376][stackoverflow.com]]. [[https://github.com/To1ne][I]] took the liberty
to put the code on github.com.
