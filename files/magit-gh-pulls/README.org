* magit-gh-pulls

  magit-gh-pulls is a [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] extension that allows you to conveniently manipulate
  Github's pull requests from Emacs.

** Installation

   magit-gh-pulls is available on [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]]. To install it do the following:

   : M-x package-install RET magit-gh-pulls RET

   Now that the package is installed you have to put the following code to your
   =init.el=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'magit-gh-pulls)
(add-hook 'magit-mode-hook 'turn-on-magit-gh-pulls)
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

***** Existing Pull Requests

      In =magit-status= window press =# g= to refresh the list of pull requests.
      magit-gh-pulls automatically infers credentials from the URL of the
      repository. You can also explicitly specify which Github project to fetch
      PRs from by executing this in your shell:

      : git config magit.gh-pulls-repo <user>/<repo> # your github repository

      If there are some PRs available, a new section will appear called *Pull
      Requests*. Each item in this section has the following form:

      : [pull-request-number@branch-name] Pull request name

      Highlighting the desired PR and pressing =# f= will fetch the commits
      associated with the PR. These are the real commits that you can view,
      apply, cherry-pick etc.

      From this point magit-gh-pulls offers you two options:

      - press =# b= on the PR to create a topic branch for this PR. After
        testing the PR you can merge it back into your branch using Magit.
      - press =# m= to merge the PR on top of the currently checked out branch.
        This is convenient if pull request can be merged by fast-forwarding and
        no testing is needed (or you can test from your branch directly). A nice
        benefit of this approach over merging from Github interface is that in
        case of FF no merge commit is produced by default, so history stays nice
        and linear. If you still want the merge commit, enable =-c= option while
        in magit-gh-pulls menu.

***** Creating Pull Requests

      In =magit-status= press =# c= to create a new pull request. You will be
      asked for the base commit and the head commit for the pull-request. They
      will default to the default branch of your repository and current head
      respectively. Enter a title and description for the pull request, and
      magit-gh-pulls will connect to GitHub to create the pull request. If =-w=
      option is enabled, the new pull request will be opened on github.com in
      the browser.

      The base and head of the pull request must already be present on github.
      If you haven't yet pushed your local commits, magit-gh-pulls will suggest
      to push them first.

***** Miscellaneous

      - =# o= Will open the selected a pull request in your default browser on GitHub.
      - =j q= will jump to the Pull Requests section in the =magit-status= window.
