* Commentary
This library provides the commands to navigate and display the mark ring.
The `show-marks' command displays a buffer listing the marks in the buffer from which it was called.
You can then press enter on one of the listed marks to jump to it, or press d to delete it from the
mark ring. You can also use the `forward-mark' and `backward-mark' commands to navigate the marks in
the mark ring. 
* Installation

 - If you have [[http://www.marmalade-repo.org/][marmalade-repo.org]], this mark is part of the emacs packages you can install.  
   Just type M-x package-install mark marmalade 
 - Otherwise download the library from here Lisp:mark.el, and put it in a directory in the emacs load path, 
   like ~/.emacs.d
 - Add (require 'show-marks) in your ~/.emacs file
 - I recommend also binding the commands to global keys, e.g:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (global-set-key (kbd "<C-s-right>") 'forward-mark)
   (global-set-key (kbd "<C-s-left>") 'backward-mark)
   (global-set-key (kbd "<C-s-down>") 'show-marks)
#+END_SRC
