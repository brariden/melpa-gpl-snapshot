[[https://melpa.org/#/jenkins][file:https://melpa.org/packages/jenkins-badge.svg]]

Minimalistic emacs-plugin for integration with Jenkins. Still in active development.
** Installation from MELPA
   This package available on MELPA.
#+begin_src
M-x package-install RET jenkins
#+end_src

** Installation from source

Jenkins.el is trivial and requires next steps:

+ Clone repo to your local disk
#+begin_src shell
$ git clone git@github.com:rmuslimov/jenkins.el.git
#+end_src
+ Add jenkins.el path to your emacs path
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<your local jenkins.el path>")
#+end_src
+ Configure next jenkins.el variables
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (setq jenkins-api-token "<api token can be found on user's configure page>")
 (setq jenkins-url "<jenkins url. Example: https://jenkins.company.com/ >")
 (setq jenkins-username "<your user name>")
 (setq jenkins-viewname "<viewname>") ;; if you're not using views skip this line
#+end_src
If you don't know your API token, it's easy to find it in jenkins user credentials page. Just visit:
#+begin_src
  Jenkins main page > People > %Select your user% > Configure > Press on "Show API Token"
#+end_src

    Jenkins.el support using main view for user just define *jenkins-viewname* and it will be used as main view for jenkins.el.

#+begin_src elisp
$ (setq jenkins-colwidth-name 35) ;; or jenkins-colwidth-id, jenkins-colwidth-last-status
#+end_src
