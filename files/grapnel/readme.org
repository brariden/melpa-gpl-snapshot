* grapnel
A HTTP request lib for Emacs with flexible callback dispatch.

grapnel is an HTTP request library that uses a curl subprocess and
offers flexible callback dispatch. Not only can you pass in an alist
of request outcomes to callback functions (see below) but you can also
override the dispatch function itself if the default one doesn't suit
your needs. Further, grapnel will build the query string, request data
(i.e., POST body), and headers from alists that are passed in.

See the inline docs for more information.
