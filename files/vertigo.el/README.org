* About
=vertigo.el= is a port of the vim [[https://github.com/prendradjaja/vim-vertigo][vertigo]] plugin and gives commands for jumping up and down by lines using the home row. For example, after pressing a key bound to a vertigo command, the user might press =k=, the 8th letter on the home row, to jump 8 lines. Vertigo is most useful when used with relative line numbering.

Evil is not required.
* Configuration
No keys are bound by default. The following commands are provided:

~vertigo-jump-up~ and ~vertigo-jump-down~ will jump an actual number of lines.

~vertigo-visible-jump-up~ and ~vertigo-visible-jump-down~ will jump a number of visible lines. For example, they will not jump into a folded org heading.

~vertigo-visual-jump-up~ and ~vertigo-visual-jump-down~ will jump a number of visual lines (as in visual-line-mode). They will not jump into invisible text and will consider a soft-wrapped line to count as the number of visual lines it takes up.

For non-QWERTY users, ~vertigo-home-row~ can be changed:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq vertigo-home-row '(?a ?r ?s ?t ?d ?h ?n ?e ?i ?o))
#+end_src

Since it is inefficient to use these commands to jump one or two lines, vertigo can take a second key as input for some keys. For example, pressing =aa= would jump 11 lines and pressing =a;= would jump 10. To control the max home row key where 2 keys are input, ~vertigo-cut-off~ can be set. It defaults to 3, meaning that 39 lines can be jumped at maximum. Pressing =d(key2)= will jump 30 something lines, but pressing =f= will immediately jump 4 lines.
