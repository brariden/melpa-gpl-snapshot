;;; Commentary:
;; This package is a port of the vim-vertigo plugin and gives commands that
;; allow the user to jump up or down a number of lines using the home row.
;; It will primarily be useful when relative line numbers are being used. To
;; jump down seven lines, for example, the user can press a key bound to
;; `vertigo-jump-down' and then press "j" since it is the seventh letter on the
;; home row. `vertigo-home-row' can be altered for non-QWERTY users. Since it is
;; unlikely that the user will want to use these commands to jump down one or
;; two lines, `vertigo-cut-off' can be set to determine that the first n keys
;; should accept another key afterwards. For example, if `vertigo-cut-off' is
;; set to its default value of 3, pressing "da" would jump 31 lines, pressing
;; "d;" would jump 30 lines, and pressing "f" would jump 4 lines.

;; For more information see the README in the github repo.

  "This determines boundary key for whether one or two keys should be input.
For example, with the default value of 3, 39 lines at max can be jumped. The
third key in `vertigo-home-row' will jump 30 something lines (depending on the
second keypress). On the other hand, pressing the fourth key will jump down 4
lines without further user input. Setting this value to 0 will make all keys
immediately jump. Setting it to 10 will make no keys immediately jump."
