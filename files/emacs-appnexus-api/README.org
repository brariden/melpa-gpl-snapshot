* Emacs + AppNexus API integration = Less Typing

  I don't love typing JSON, especially all the silly double-quotes and
  the commas. I don't like typing out repetitive strings on the
  command line, like involved =curl= incantations. I am
  lazy. Therefore I'm trying to write Elisp instead of JSON, and make
  calls to the API using keyboard shortcuts.

  Requires the following built-in packages:

  - =cl=
  - =json=
  - =url=
