* what is clean-buffers

clean-buffers is a little tool that used to clean useless buffers which means buffers match specify regex (see `clean-buffer-useless-buffer-names') or undisplayed time exceeded certain time (see `clean-buffer-useless-buffer-timeout')

* How to use

config `useless-buffer-names' or `useless-buffer-time-out' and then execute the following commands:

`clean-buffers-kill-useless-buffers' to clean useless buffers

or `clean-buffers-turn-on-auto-clean-buffers' to clean useless buffers automatically

* Customization

+ clean-buffers-judge-useless-buffer-functions
  
  function list which used to determine a buffer is useless or not 

  the function will take a buffer as the only argument and should return non-nil when the buffer is a useless buffer.

+ clean-buffers-useless-buffer-time-out
