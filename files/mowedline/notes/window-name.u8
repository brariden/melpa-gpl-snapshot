    ;;;XXX: what is the difference between using xstorename and
    ;;;     xsetwmname?  xstorename is just a shortcut?
    (xstorename dpy window "foo")


    (let ((title (make-xtextproperty))
          (str (xtextproperty-make "foo")))
      ;(set-xtextproperty-value! title str)
      (xstringlisttotextproperty str 1 title)
      (xsetwmname dpy window title)
      ;(free-xtextproperty title) ;; should do this at end of program?
      )
