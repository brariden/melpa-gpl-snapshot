* gmail2bbdb (v0.0.4)

[[http://melpa.org/#/gmail2bbdb][file:http://melpa.org/packages/gmail2bbdb-badge.svg]] [[http://stable.melpa.org/#/gmail2bbdb][file:http://stable.melpa.org/packages/gmail2bbdb-badge.svg]]

gmail2bbdb will import name and email from [[https://www.google.com/contacts/][Gmail contacts]] into BBDB file. So you can auto-complete email address in Emacs.

Please note the BBDB file *only contains name and email address*. I remove useless BBDB features to minimize the maintaining cost.

* Why
- Easy to use. Only one command.
- Robust. It has NO dependency.
- Long term support. I will maintain it in next 10 years.

* Install
Download gmail2bbdb.el and place it somewhere (say ~/.emacs/lisp). Add below code into your .emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(autoload 'gmail2bbdb-import-file "gmail2bbdb" nil t nil)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
- Install [[https://melpa.org/#/bbdb][latest BBDB from melpa]]
- At [[https://www.google.com/contacts][Gmail contacts page]], click "More -> Export -> vCard format -> Export", the file "contacts.vcf" will be downloaded.
- Run command "M-x gmail2bbdb-import-file" and select contacts.vcf. "$HOME/.bbdb" will be created.

You can specify a different path of output file,
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq gmail2bbdb-bbdb-file "~/.emacs.d/.bbdb")
#+END_SRC

You can specify the email excluded patterns. Email address matching one of the patterns will be excluded.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'gmail2bbdb-excluded-email-regex-list "noreply@mycompany.com")
#+END_SRC
