This emacs lisp package provides functions similar to `thing-at-point' of `thingatpt.el'.

[[http://melpa.org/#/xah-get-thing][file:http://melpa.org/packages/xah-get-thing-badge.svg]]

The functions are:

- xah-get-thing-at-cursor
- xah-get-thing-or-selection

They get “things” independent of syntax table, so you always get same thing regardless what's current major mode.

They allow you to get text selection when there's active region.

Just call describe-function on them to read the inline doc.

For more detail, see home page: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_get-selection-or-unit.html
