;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides functions similar to `thing-at-point' of `thingatpt.el'.

;; The functions are:

;; xah-get-thing-at-cursor
;; xah-get-thing-or-selection

;; They get “thing” independent of syntax table, so you always get same thing regardless what's current major mode.

;; xah-get-thing-or-selection get text selection when there's active region.

;; Call describe-function on them to read the inline doc.

;;; Code:

(defun xah-get-thing-at-cursor (φunit)
  "Return the string and boundary of ΦUNIT under cursor.
Returns vector [text a b], where text is the string and a b are its boundary.

ΦUNIT can be:

• 'word — sequence of hyphen, 0 to 9, A to Z, a to z, and other chars such as àáâãäå.

• 'glyphs — sequence of visible glyphs. Useful for file name, URL, …, anything doesn't have white spaces in it.

• 'line — delimited by “\\n”. (captured text does not include “\\n”.)

• 'block — delimited by empty lines or beginning/end of buffer. Lines with just spaces or tabs are also considered empty line. (captured text does not include a ending “\\n”.)

• 'buffer — whole buffer. (respects `narrow-to-region')

• 'filepath — delimited by chars that's USUALLY not part of filepath.

• 'url — delimited by chars that's USUALLY not part of URL.

• a vector [beginRegex endRegex] — The elements are regex strings used to determine the beginning/end of boundary chars. They are passed to `skip-chars-backward' and `skip-chars-forward'. For example, if you want paren as delimiter, use [\"^(\" \"^)\"]

Example usage:
 (setq bds (xah-get-thing-at-cursor 'line))
 (setq inputstr (elt bds 0) p1 (elt bds 1) p2 (elt bds 2)  )

This function is similar to `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.
The main differences are:

• This function returns the text and the 2 boundaries as a vector in one shot.

• 'line always returns the line without end of line character, avoiding inconsistency when the line is at end of buffer.

• This function's behavior does not depend on syntax table. e.g. for units 「'word」, 「'block」, etc."
