Integration of [vimish-fold](https://github.com/mrkkrp/vimish-fold) with [evil](https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/wiki/Home)

Adds standard vim keybindings of <kbd>zf</kbd> and <kbd>zd</kbd> to create and delete folds (via
`vimish-fold`) respectively. Also hooks into `evil` so the usual vim
keybindings for fold toggling (<kbd>za</kbd>), opening (<kbd>zo</kbd>), closing (<kbd>zc</kbd>) etc all work as expected with `vimish-fold`.

This provides a near-complete vim folding experience in evil for Emacs.


## Installation

### MELPA

The preferred way to install `evil-vimish-fold` is via
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) - then you can just <kbd>M-x package-install RET
evil-vimish-fold RET</kbd>

### Manual

If you would like to install the package manually, download or clone it and
place within Emacs' `load-path`, then you can require it in your init file like
this:

```emacs-lisp
(require 'evil-vimish-fold)
```

NOTE: This will also require the manual installation of `evil` and `vimish-fold`
if you have not done so already.
