* Start Menu

start-menu is a little tool that will add a "Start" menu in the menu bar.

You can use the Start menu to executing external program just like the start menu in windows.

* Usage

If you are using debian linux or ubuntu linux just  =M-x start-menu-enable=

Otherwise, you should config start-menu-menu-conf first then =M-x start-menu-enable=

For Windows user: the path to program often contains space, so may be you should use "" to quote the path

If you don't need Start menu any more,just =M-x start-menu-disable=

Since many user hidden the menu bar, so there is also a command =start-menu-popup= which will pop up the start menu.
