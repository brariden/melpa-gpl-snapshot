* test-kitchen.el -- Run test-kitchen inside of emacs

** Overview

This plugin allows you to run your test-kitchen run inside of Emacs.
No need to shell out or tab out to run `kitchen` commands.

This plugin also assumes you have [[https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/][ChefDK]] installed.

I'd like to thank [[https://twitter.com/camdez][Cameron Desautels]] for the jump start on this project. /me tips my hat to you sir.

I'd also like to thank [[http://twitter.com/ionrock][Eric Larson]] for pushing me to keep this alive.

This plugin was also inspired from the following sites:
- http://blog.binchen.org/posts/open-readme-under-git-root-directory-in-emacs.html
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/821853/splitting-window-in-emacs-lisp-function

** Key bindings

The following key bindings are just suggestions, I just didn't have these bound to anything.

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-d") 'test-kitchen-destroy)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-t") 'test-kitchen-test)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'test-kitchen-list)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-v") 'test-kitchen-verify)
#+END_SRC
