;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode also assumes you have [[https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/][ChefDK]] installed.
;;
;; I'd like to thank [[https://twitter.com/camdez][Cameron Desautels]] for the jump start on this project. /me tips my hat to you sir.
;;
;; I'd also like to thank [[http://twitter.com/ionrock][Eric Larson]] for pushing me to keep this alive.
;;
;; This minor mode allows you to run test-kitchen in a seporate buffer
;;
;;  * Run test-kitchen destroy in another buffer
;;  * Run test-kitchen list in another buffer
;;  * Run test-kitchen test in another buffer
;;  * Run test-kitchen verify in another buffer
;;
;; You'll probably want to define some key bindings to run these.
