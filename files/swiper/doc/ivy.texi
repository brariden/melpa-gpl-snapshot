Ivy manual, version 0.7.0

Ivy is an interactive interface for completion in Emacs. Emacs uses
completion mechanism in a variety of contexts: code, menus, commands,
variables, functions, etc. Completion entails listing, sorting,
filtering, previewing, and applying actions on selected items. When
active, @code{ivy-mode} completes the selection process by narrowing
available choices while previewing in the minibuffer. Selecting the
final candidate is either through simple keyboard character inputs or
through powerful regular expressions. @end ifnottex

@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Ivy is for quick and easy selection from a list. When Emacs prompts
for a string from a list of several possible choices, Ivy springs into
action to assist in narrowing and picking the right string from a vast
number of choices.

Ivy strives for minimalism, simplicity, customizability and
discoverability.

@subsubheading Minimalism
Uncluttered minibuffer is minimalism. Ivy shows the completion
defaults, the number of matches, and 10 candidate matches below the
input line. Customize @code{ivy-length} to adjust the number of candidate
matches displayed in the minibuffer.

@subsubheading Simplicity
Simplicity is about Ivy's behavior in the minibuffer. It is also about
the code interface to extend Ivy's functionality. The minibuffer area
behaves as close to @code{fundamental-mode} as possible. @kbd{SPC} inserts a
space, for example, instead of being bound to the more complex
@code{minibuffer-complete-word}. Ivy's code uses easy-to-examine global
variables; avoids needless complications with branch-introducing
custom macros.

@subsubheading Customizability
Customizability is about being able to use different methods and
interfaces of completion to tailor the selection process. For example,
adding a custom display function that points to a selected candidate
with @code{->}, instead of highlighting the selected candidate with the
@code{ivy-current-match} face. Or take the customization of actions, say
after the candidate function is selected. @kbd{RET} uses
@code{counsel-describe-function} to describe the function, whereas @kbd{M-o d}
jumps to that function's definition in the code. The @kbd{M-o} prefix can
be uniformly used with characters like @kbd{d} to group similar actions.

@subsubheading Discoverability
Ivy displays easily discoverable commands through the hydra facility.
@kbd{C-o} in the minibuffer displays a hydra menu. It opens up within an
expanded minibuffer area. Each menu item comes with short
documentation strings and highlighted one-key completions. So
discovering even seldom used keys is simply a matter of @kbd{C-o} in the
minibuffer while in the midst of the Ivy interaction. This
discoverability minimizes exiting Ivy interface for documentation
look-ups.

@node Installing from Emacs Package Manager
@section Installing from Emacs Package Manager

@kbd{M-x} @code{package-install} @kbd{RET} @code{swiper} @kbd{RET}

Ivy is installed as part of @code{swiper} package. @code{swiper} is available
from two different package archives, GNU ELPA and MELPA. For the
latest stable version, use the GNU ELPA archives using the above M-x
command.

For current hourly builds, use the MELPA archives. See the code below
for adding MELPA to the list of package archives:


@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
@end lisp

After this do @kbd{M-x} @code{package-refresh-contents} @kbd{RET}, followed by
@kbd{M-x} @code{package-install} @kbd{RET} @code{swiper} @kbd{RET}.

For package manager details, see @ref{Packages,,,emacs,}.

This behavior is off by default.

@node Key bindings for single selection action then exit minibuffer
@subsection Key bindings for single selection, action, then exit minibuffer

Ivy can offer several actions from which to choose which action to
run. This "calling an action" operates on the selected candidate. For
example, when viewing a list of files, one action could open it for
editing, one to view it, another to invoke a special function, and so
on. Custom actions can be added to this interface. The precise action
to call on the selected candidate can be delayed until after the
narrowing is completed. No need to exit the interface if unsure which
action to run. This delayed flexibility and customization of actions
extends usability of lists in Emacs.

@kbd{C-m} or @kbd{RET} (@code{ivy-done}) calls the default action and exits the
minibuffer.

@kbd{M-o} (@code{ivy-dispatching-done}) presents all available valid actions
from which to choose. When there is only one action available, there
is no difference between @kbd{M-o} and @kbd{C-m}.

@kbd{C-j} (@code{ivy-alt-done}) calls the alternate action, such as completing
a directory name in a file list whereas @kbd{C-m} will select that directory
and exit the minibuffer.

Exiting the minibuffer also closes the Ivy window (as specified by
@code{ivy-height}). This closing and exiting sequence is conveniently off
when applying multiple actions. Multiple actions and multiple
selections as covered in the next section of this manual.

@kbd{TAB} (@code{ivy-partial-or-done}) attempts partial completion, extending
current input as much as possible.

@kbd{TAB TAB} is the same as @kbd{C-j}.

@kbd{C-M-j} (@code{ivy-immediate-done}) is useful when there is no match for
the given input. Or there is an incorrect partial match. @kbd{C-M-j} with
@code{find-file} lists ignores the partial match and instead takes the
current input to create a new directory with @code{dired-create-directory}.

@code{ivy-immediate-done} illustrates how Ivy distinguishes between calling
an action on the @emph{currently selected} candidate and calling an action
on the @emph{current input}.

Invoking avy completion with @kbd{C-'} (@code{ivy-avy}).
@kbd{C-`} uses avy's visible jump mechanism, which can further reduce
Ivy's line-by-line scrolling that requires multiple @kbd{C-n} or @kbd{C-p}
keystrokes.

@node Key bindings for multiple selections and actions keep minibuffer open
@subsection Key bindings for multiple selections and actions, keep minibuffer open

For repeatedly applying multiple actions or acting on multiple
candidates, Ivy does not close the minibuffer between commands. It
keeps the minibuffer open for applying subsequent actions.

Adding an extra meta key to the normal key chord invokes the special
version of the regular commands that enables applying multiple
actions.

@kbd{C-M-m} (@code{ivy-call}) is the non-exiting version of the default action,
@kbd{C-m} (@code{ivy-done}). Instead of closing the minibuffer, @kbd{C-M-m} allows
selecting another candidate or another action. For example, @kbd{C-M-m} on
functions list invokes @code{describe-function}. When combined with @kbd{C-n},
function descriptions can be invoked quickly in succession.

@kbd{RET} exits the minibuffer.

@code{ivy-resume} recalls the state of the completion session just before
its last exit. Useful after an accidental @kbd{C-m} (@code{ivy-done}).

@kbd{C-M-o} (@code{ivy-dispatching-call}) is a non-exiting version of @kbd{M-o}
(@code{ivy-dispatching-done}) that can accumulate candidates into a queue.
For example, for playback in @code{counsel-rhythmbox}, @kbd{C-M-o e} en-queues
the selected candidate, and @kbd{C-n C-m} plays the next one in the queue.

@kbd{C-M-n} (@code{ivy-next-line-and-call}) combines @kbd{C-n} and @kbd{C-M-m}. Applies
an action and moves to next line. Comes in handy when opening multiple
files from @code{counsel-find-file}, @code{counsel-git-grep}, @code{counsel-ag}, or
@code{counsel-locate} lists. Just hold @kbd{C-M-n} for rapid-fire default
action on each successive element of the list.

@kbd{C-M-p} (@code{ivy-previous-line-and-call}) combines @kbd{C-p} and @kbd{C-M-m}. Is
the same as above except that it moves through the list in the other
direction.

@node Key bindings that alter minibuffer input
@subsection Key bindings that alter minibuffer input

@kbd{M-n} (@code{ivy-next-history-element}) and @kbd{M-p}
(@code{ivy-previous-history-element}) cycle through the Ivy command
history. Ivy updates an internal history list after each action. When
this history list is empty, @kbd{M-n} inserts symbol (or URL) at point
into the minibuffer.

@kbd{M-i} (@code{ivy-insert-current}) inserts the current candidate into the
minibuffer. Useful for copying and renaming files, for example: @kbd{M-i}
to insert the original file name string, edit it, and then @kbd{C-m} to
complete the renaming.

@kbd{M-j} (@code{ivy-yank-word}) inserts sub-word at point into minibuffer. This
is similar to @kbd{C-s C-w} with @code{isearch}. Ivy reserves @kbd{C-w} for
@code{kill-region}.

@kbd{S-SPC} (@code{ivy-restrict-to-matches}) deletes the current input, and
resets the candidates list to the currently restricted matches. This
is how Ivy provides narrowing in successive tiers.

@kbd{C-r} (@code{ivy-reverse-i-search}) works just like @kbd{C-r} at bash command
prompt, where the completion candidates are the history items. Upon
completion, the selected candidate string is inserted into the
minibuffer.

@node Other key bindings
@subsection Other key bindings

@kbd{M-w} (@code{ivy-kill-ring-save}) copies selected candidates to the kill
ring; when the region is active, copies active region.

@node Hydra in the minibuffer
@subsection Hydra in the minibuffer

@kbd{C-o} (@code{hydra-ivy/body}) invokes Hydra menus with key shortcuts.

@kbd{C-o} or @kbd{i} resumes editing.

Hydra reduces key strokes, for example: @kbd{C-n C-n C-n C-n} is @kbd{C-o
jjjj} in Hydra. Hydra has other benefits besides certain shorter key
bindings:
@itemize
@item
@kbd{<} and @kbd{>} to adjust height of minibuffer,
@item
describes the current completion state, such as case folding and the
current action.
@end itemize

Minibuffer editing is disabled when Hydra is active.

@node Saving the current completion session to a buffer
@subsection Saving the current completion session to a buffer

@kbd{C-c C-o} (@code{ivy-occur}) saves the current candidates to a new buffer;
the list is active in the new buffer.

@kbd{RET} or @kbd{mouse-1} in the new buffer calls the appropriate action on
the selected candidate.

Ivy has no limit on the number of active buffers like these.

Ivy takes care of making these buffer names unique. It applies
descriptive names, for example: @code{*ivy-occur counsel-describe-variable
"function$*}.

@node Completion styles
@chapter Completion styles

Ivy's completion functions rely on the highly configurable regex
builder.

The default is:

@lisp
(setq ivy-re-builders-alist
      '((t . ivy--regex-plus)))
@end lisp

The default @code{ivy--regex-plus} narrowing is always invoked unless
specified otherwise. For example, file name completion may have a
custom completion function:

@lisp
(setq ivy-re-builders-alist
      '((read-file-name-internal . ivy--regex-fuzzy)
        (t . ivy--regex-plus)))
@end lisp

Ivy's flexibility extends to using different styles of completion
mechanics (regex-builders) for different types of lists. Despite this
flexibility, Ivy operates within a consistent and uniform interface.
The main regex-builders currently in Ivy are:
@menu
* ivy--regex-plus::
* ivy--regex-ignore-order::
* ivy--regex-fuzzy::
@end menu

@node ivy--regex-plus
@section ivy--regex-plus

@code{ivy--regex-plus} is Ivy's default completion method.

@code{ivy--regex-plus} matches by splitting the input by spaces and
rebuilding it into a regex.

As the search string is typed in Ivy's minibuffer, it is transformed
into proper regex syntax. If the string is "for example", it is
transformed into

@verbatim
"\\(for\\).*\\(example\\)"
@end verbatim

which in regex terminology matches "for" followed by a wild card and
then "example". Note how Ivy uses the space character to build
wild cards. For literal white space matching in Ivy, use an extra space:
to match one space type two spaces, to match two spaces type three
spaces, and so on.

As Ivy transforms typed characters into regex strings, it provides an
intuitive feedback through font highlights.

Ivy supports regexp negation with "!". For example, "define key ! ivy
quit" first selects everything matching "define.*key", then removes
everything matching "ivy", and finally removes everything matching
"quit". What remains is the final result set of the negation regexp.

@verbatim
Standard regexp identifiers work:

"^", "$", "\b" or "[a-z]"
@end verbatim

Since Ivy treats minibuffer input as a regexp, standard regexp
identifiers work as usual. The exceptions are spaces, which
translate to ".*", and "!" that signal the beginning of a negation
group.

@node ivy--regex-ignore-order
@section ivy--regex-ignore-order

@code{ivy--regex-ignore-order} ignores the order of regexp tokens when
searching for matching candidates. For instance, the input "for
example" will match "example test for". Otherwise @code{ivy--regex-plus}
normal behavior is to honor the order of regexp tokens.

@node ivy--regex-fuzzy
@section ivy--regex-fuzzy

@code{ivy--regex-fuzzy} splits each character with a wild card. Searching
for "for" returns all "f.*o.*r" matches, resulting in a large number
of hits.  Yet some searches need these extra hits. Ivy sorts such
large lists using @code{flx} package's scoring mechanism, if it's
installed.
