= LXC integration =

I only wish I got paid to do Emacs all day, instead, I get paid to do
DevOps type stuff.

LXC is a cool way to do operating system virtualization on Linux
kernels. The user commands are a little annoying though. Hence an
Emacs interface is useful.

Right now this can only list containers and it presumes you use
{{{sudo}}} to list them.

== Todo ==

Possible stuff we could do is:

* offer standard start stop mechanics from the list
* allow a shell to be created inside the container?
** using attach -- {{{sudo lxc-attach -n name -- su - username}}}
** is it possible to do this with eshell?

And we always remember, when we're working through this todo list,
that we're now getting paid to do Emacs all day.
