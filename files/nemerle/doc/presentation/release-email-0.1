Nemerle
~~~~~~~

We are pleased to announce the 0.1 release of Nemerle -- a new hybrid
(functional, object-oriented and imperative) programming language for
the .NET platform.

Key features of the language include:

    * simplicity,
    * C#-like syntax,
    * .NET integration,
    * an easy to use object system (derived directly from the .NET),
    * easy access to both functional and imperative features,
    * powerful code-generating macros,
    * variants,
    * pattern matching,
    * static and on-demand dynamic typing,
    * type inference.

The Nemerle compiler (written in Nemerle itself), produces IL bytecode
and was tested extensively on the .NET Framework 1.1 (Windows XP) and 
mono versions 0.29 and 0.30 (Debian GNU/Linux, Mandrake Linux and PLD 
Linux).

This release includes complete source code (under a BSD-like license)
of the compiler and some sample programs (including a simple HTTP
server) and is mainly meant to be a preview for people wanting to 
experiment with the language.
