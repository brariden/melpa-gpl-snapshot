# magit-find-file

[magit](https://github.com/magit/magit) powered equivalent of
TextMate's `cmd-t` functionality (or
[ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim), if that's your bag).

Depends on Magit.

## Installation

Install it from [Melpa](https://melpa.org/), or drop
`magit-find-file.el` into your load path and add:

```emacs
(require 'magit-find-file)
```

into your `init.el`. The Melpa version uses `autoload`, so once
installed you won't need to add anything to your `init.el`.

## Finding files

Invoking `magit-find-file-completing-read` will give you a list of
candidates as ascertained by `git ls-files`. So basically all the
files you should care about. It includes staged and not-yet-added
files in the list.

You may want to add it as a key command:

```emacs
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'magit-find-file-completing-read)
```
