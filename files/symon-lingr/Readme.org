** Usage

This script provides a new symon-monitor =symon-lingr-monitor=, that
reports number of unread Lingr messages.

To use =symon-lingr-monitor=, first load this script and setup your
Lingr account. =symon-lingr-user-name= and =symon-lingr-password= are
required to log in to Lingr. You can omit =symon-lingr-log-file= but
all messages are mark ed as unread that case.

: (require 'symon-lingr)
: (setq symon-lingr-user-name "*YOUR_USERNAME_GOES_HERE*"
:       symon-lingr-password  "*YOUR_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE*"
:       symon-lingr-log-file  "~/.emacs.d/symon_lingr")

Then add =symon-lingr-monitor= to =symon-monitors= and turn
=symon-mode= on.

: (add-to-list 'symon-monitors 'symon-lingr-monitor t)
: (symon-mode 1)

After turning =symon-mode= on, following commands are available in
addition :

  - =M-x symon-lingr-display= :: display all unread messages (and mark
       as read)

  - =M-x symon-lingr-say= :: post a new message

You can optionally bind some keys to the commands.

: (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-l") 'symon-lingr-display)

** Customization

- =symon-lingr-muted-rooms= :: List of room names not to subscribe.

- =symon-lingr-enable-notification= :: When non-nil, echo new messages
     in the minibuffer.
