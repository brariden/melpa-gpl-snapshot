Development
===========



The mission of voca-builder is to help user to improve their English
language skills by building up their vocabularies. It depends on the
open software and free-of-charge online dictionary database, and
therefore it is an open software. The source code can be found at the
`yitang/voca-builder <https://github.com/yitang/voca-builder>`_ repository on GitHub.

I intent to update it regularly to account for its dependence's
upgrading, and also to provides more features. But I am not an Emacs
Lisp expert and I am actively seek collaboration. Any contribution to
this package in terms of suggestion or implementation will be highly
appreciated.

My current development plan:

First Release
-------------



The first release of voca-builder has built a platform that user can
look-up and records with new vocabularies. 

Second Release (now)
--------------------



Clean up the code base and complete the first set of documentations so
that it would be easier for others to take on

Third Release
-------------



The second release of voca-builder should focus on helping user to
memorise the vocabulary.

Memory Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Integrate a scientific algorithms to improve user's learning and
memorising.

Both features can be in write an front-end for `org-drill <http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html>`_. 

Flash Card
~~~~~~~~~~



To help user to revise the new vocabulary by using flash card to
stimulate one's memory.

Fourth Release
--------------



The third release of voca-builder should focus on the API and talking
with other platform that has similar mission, like
`http://www.cram.com/ <http://www.cram.com/>`_, `https://quizlet.com <https://quizlet.com>`_ etc.
