If you are learning a foreign language, you know how tedious and
time-consuming it is to check a new word that you are not familiar
with. The full process of lookup and recording can take up to 6
steps:

1. stop reading if you are not familiar with the word but you know it
   is really important,

2. fetch a dictionary or a gadget,

3. look for the word,

4. try to comprehensive it,

5. then you write it down in your vocabulary book, with the meaning,

6. if you are very serious, you probably write down the sentence as an
   example.


After all these, you go back to continue reading but lost the flow.
voca-builder can do all the tasks, except from 4, for you without your
involvement, all you need to do is press F4 key or any other you prefer.

Stay Focused in Reading

After you search a word, voca-builde will first look-up the dictionary
database, ususally take less than 0.5 seconds, then popup the meaning
of a vocabulary just above the or below the sentence you were reading.
Because it is so quick, you don't have to move your eyeballs, and
therefore stay focus on.

Enjoy Human-Friendly Dictionary
-------------------------------

Most of the dictionaries are boring. Take consciousness for example,
definition from Oxford Dictionary is

::

    [MASS NOUN] The state of being aware of and responsive to one’s surroundings

The excellent educators in vocabulary.com makes it fun! For
consciousness, it has short and long meanings, as shown below.

::

    When you are awake and aware of your surroundings, that's
    consciousness. There are different types of consciousness, including
    social consciousness, being aware of injustices in society.

::

    The early Latin word conscius meant "with knowing," but it meant a
    shared knowledge, a meaning that was retained through the 16th
    Century. John Locke was the first to describe consciousness in
    relation to the individual, referring to it as “the perception of what
    passes in a man’s own mind." If you lose consciousness during the
    performance, we'll wake you up with some smelling salts! 

You'd agree with me they are fun, and easy to read. We not only know
the meaning of the word, but also the roots and how to use it in an
excellent situation.
