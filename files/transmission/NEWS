* Changes in 0.8

** Features

*** `transmission-add` now has a conditional default argument.
The default argument is a guess of a valid torrent at point, either as
a URL, file name, magnet link, or info hash. The behavior can be
customized with the new variable `transmission-torrent-functions`.

*** New one-line pieces display.
Visible when new custom variable `transmission-pieces-display' is set
to 'brief.

** Changes

*** Global upload limit and seed ratio limit can be set to zero.

* Changes in 0.7

** Features

*** Removing trackers can now (finally) be done by announce URL
in addition to removal by tracker ID.

*** Numbers in the *info* buffer now have comma separators

*** `transmission-request-async' has a new argument CALLBACK.

*** More information is shown for trackers.
This includes announce/scrape times and the error string for failed
announces.

*** More information is shown for peers.
Peers "interested" in receiving and with "unchoked" bandwidth are
shown. Additionally shown are numbers of peers coming from either DHT,
PEX, etc.

*** New custom variable `transmission-trackers'.
This is used to store trackers which are added to the completion
candidates when adding a tracker to a torrent.

*** New command `transmission-trackers-replace'

** Fixes

*** The file list header line updates correctly when units change.

* Changes in 0.6

** Features

*** Each major mode now has a menu

*** Torrent list conditionally shows âˆž in place of Inf for ETA

*** Adding trackers now has completion.
The collection of things to complete is a list of trackers from all
torrents known to transmission.

*** Applied some optimizations

**** Replaced some seq- functions with their (faster) cl- counterparts.
Ultimately dropped the dependency on seq.el

**** `transmission-draw-info' should be faster now

**** Set `line-move-visual' to nil in tabulated-list buffers

*** New function `transmission-request-async` for sending requests
without blocking to wait for a response.

* Changes in 0.5

** Features

*** Download directory can be specified when adding a torrent
by prefixing `transmission-add`

*** New command `transmission-move` for changing download directory

*** `tabulated-list-mode` is employed for torrent and file listing.
This adds some sorting facilities to these listings, as well as a
header line.

*** New command `transmission-find-file' for visiting from the file list

*** More information is shown in the info context

*** Pieces are only shown if the torrent is in progress.
A count of pieces obtained and a percentage are shown.

** Changes

*** Renamed some things

**** `transmission-file-size-units' renamed to `transmission-units'

** Fixes

*** transmission-quit is smarter now

*** More use is made of global and buffer-local variables
For instance, `transmission-torrent-id`, `transmission-torrent-vector`

* Changes in 0.4.1

*** Display of pieces is now correct

*** `transmission-files-command` now tries incomplete .part files

*** Use 'font-lock-face instead of 'font property
Fontification goes missing sometimes otherwise

* Changes in 0.4

** Features

*** Switching buffers is way less annoying now
Point/mark is better preserved in buffers.  Opening the info and files
buffers simply refresh if they are the same one (torrent id) that was
drawn before.  The transmission-draw and transmission-refresh
functions now do what they're supposed to do.

*** Torrents can now be added by BitTorrent info hash

*** New commands for adding and removing trackers

*** Support for RPC username and password

*** More HTTP errors are caught
401 for bad RPC credentials, and a few others for an incorrect path
to the RPC

** Customization

*** Session address
The RPC path variable `transmission-path' is now named
`transmission-rpc-path'.

*** RPC authorization
New variable `transmission-rpc-auth' allows RPC username and password
to be configured.

** Bug fixes

*** transmission-prop-values-in-region does the right thing now

* Changes in 0.3

** Features

*** New commands for bandwidth priority, reannounce, global seed ratio
limit

*** Leading directory in files list is truncated if possible

*** Added more torrent information to *transmission-info* buffer.
Tracker URLs and tiers, along with peers, seeders, leechers, and
snatches from each are displayed.

Minimal peer information--numbers connected, seeding, leeching--is
displayed.

Torrent pieces are now displayed.  Needs fixing.

** Added a Makefile and README

** Bug fixes

*** Fixed issue with not being able to add .torrent files.

*** Fixed a divide-by-zero bug.

* Changes in 0.2

** Now compatible with stable Emacs 24.4

* Changes in 0.1

** Basic Transmission torrent client. "transmission.el" is an interface
to a Transmission session for GNU Emacs.

Entry points are the `transmission' and `transmission-add' commands.

A variety of commands are available for manipulating torrents.  Some
of them can be applied over multiple torrents simultaneously by
selecting them within a region.

*** Features a torrent list and two other contexts: one for the files
contained in a torrent, the other for detailed information about the
torrent.

One can start/stop, verify, and remove torrents, set global rate
limits, and set individual file priorities.

*** Customization

**** Session address
The variables `transmission-host', `transmission-service', and
`transmission-path' have the default of a local Transmission session.

**** Appearance
The variables `transmission-file-size-units' and
`transmission-time-format' control the appearance of
file-size/bitrates and dates, respectively.

**** Timer
The variables `transmission-timer-p' and `transmission-timer-interval'
control whether the torrent list updates automatically, and at what
period.
