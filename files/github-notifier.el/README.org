  =github-notifier= is a global minor-mode for Emacs that displays your GitHub
  notifications unread count in mode-line. It checks the GitHub Notifications
  API every minute.

   If you want to call it from lisp (i.e., =(github-notifier-mode 1)=), make
   sure =github-notifier-token= has been set up FIRSTLY, consult its doc-string
   to learn how to generate an access token.
