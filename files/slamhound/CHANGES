Changes from 1.5.4 to 1.5.5, 30 April 2014
==========================================

- Bind *ns* to file's ns during read. This solves an issue where Slamhound may
  incorrectly alias namespaces as `user` when run from the command line.

- Add support for definterface and gen-class.

Changes from 1.5.3 to 1.5.4, 03 April 2014
==========================================

- Prefer imports whose package name matches a project namespace.

- Detect class names in metadata used for Java annotations.

- Fix detection of metadata attached to literal collections.

- Fix two file handle leaks.

- Call (shutdown-agents) in slam.hound/-main.

- Allow the file arguments of `swap-in-reconstructed-ns-form` and
  `reconstruct` to be anything implementing clojure.java.io/Coercions.

- Use the system file separator when searching for files to reconstruct.

- Parse ns declarations that incorrectly use symbols instead of keywords for
  ns reference clauses. e.g. `(require [])` vs `(:require [])`

Changes from 1.5.2 to 1.5.3, 23 March 2014
==========================================

- Add support for the :rename option in :require and :use forms.

- Add support for core.typed.

- Blacklist all namespaces beginning with "cljs". When Slamhound supports
  ClojureScript, this will be revisited.

- Correctly identify aliases that shadow existing namespaces.

- Fix "Disjoin current ns from candidate namespaces" from 1.5.0.

- Update ns pretty-printing for long :require libspecs.

Changes from 1.5.1 to 1.5.2, 14 March 2014
==========================================

- Handle case where an alias is used to refer to private vars.

- Use a cache to greatly improve the performance of repeated searches for
  a missing reference type.

- Improve class import search performance.

- Find namespaces with trailing and mixed dashes/underscores when importing
  classes created by deftype and defrecord.

Changes from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1, 29 January 2014
============================================

- Require matching ns when importing classes created by deftype and defrecord.

- Support vars with Unicode characters.

- No more reflection warnings.

Changes from 1.4.0 to 1.5.0, 24 November 2013
=============================================

- Prefer aliases with shorter "alias" distance (number of insertions to create
  anchored subsequence).

- Prefer alias that are namespace initialisms.

- Prevent multiple aliases to a single namespace.

- Disjoin current ns from candidate namespaces.

- Prefer candidates from project namespaces.

- Find consumed references within syntax-quotes. Closes #14

- Find special case token `/` and vars with trailing `'`s during regrow.

- Prefer capitalized vars that shadow class names when they appear in the old
  ns map. Closes #27

- Use old ns form to disambiguate potential classes for import. Closes #26

- The :require flags :reload, :reload-all, and :verbose are parsed and
  re-emitted.

- Parse multiple ns clauses of the same type.

- Metadata maps in ns forms are parsed and re-emitted.

- Multiple :key value options are emitted per libspec; i.e. no separate :as
  and :refer vectors.

- Refer candidates are now subject to :exclude rules from the old ns.

- Excluding vars in clojure.core also excludes vars from cljs.core.

- New ns form parser for more reliable disambiguation.

- Allow slamhound.el to work with either nrepl.el or cider.

- Include dynamically generated Classes in :import search.

- Avoid excessive tempfile creation.

- Honor existing :refer :all and :use clauses.

- Preserve file comment headers.

- Fix multiline docstrings.

- Drop support for slime from elisp interface.

Changes from 1.3.3 to 1.4.0, 20 June 2013
=========================================

- Force print newlines between namespaces in short :requires. Closes #23

- Fix docstring unescaping. Closes #40

- Prefer candidates where last segment matches.

- Ignore temp files when globbing directories.

- Make sure the PushBackReader is actually closed.

- Remove lein1 compatibility gunk.
