   After synchronization, [hb'] is equal to:
     (b_0 = init a_0, b_1 = fold a_1 b_0, b_2 = fold a_2 b_1, ...)
   [check] function is called to check if two items are still valid, in order
   to minimize work and update [hb] incrementally.

   If second argument is None, then this function behave like
   [reconstruct ~init ~fold ha] with an empty tail.
