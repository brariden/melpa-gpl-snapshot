merlin 2.2
==========
Wed May 20 09:44:55 EDT 2015

  backend:
    - completion
        + return the type of the expected argument when completing an
          application.
          This allows us to offer completion for named and optional parameters,
          as well as polymorphic variants
        + optionally associates ocamldoc comments to candidates
        + adds field completion inside records ( #296 )
    - locate:
        + partially rewritten, introduces a new kind of cache
          (so potentially noticeably bigger memory consumption)
        + better handling of functors
        + handle local modules
        + fix occasional "inconsistent assumptions"
    - error reporting:
        + handle environment errors (inconsistent assumptions, …)
        + filter duplicated messages
        + fix type error reporting:
            "this expression has type t = t but an expression was expected of
            type u = u"
          we now only print the equality when it adds some information
        + less noisy pattern recovery: when every pattern is recovered, consider
          that the matched expression is the the source of the problem, and
          retry typing with "'a" as the type of the matched expression.
    - add support for trunk
    - add a "document" command: takes an ident and return its documentation (if
      any)
    - destruct: use more precise environments ( #389 )
    - warnings:
        + check signature inclusion to prevent spurious warnings about unused
          declarations
        + backport 4.02-style warning management
        + add a dump command
    - nonrec: update implementation to more-or-less match the upstream one
      (upstream >= 4.02.2)
    - parser: improve marking heuristic in presence of ;; or toplevel
      directives.
    - typeof: during verbose expansion, also print the type declaration if we
      have a type constructor

  emacs:
    - fix bindings of every completion backend
    - bind ocamldoc comments to company (optional)
    - detect race conditions when running synchronous commands
    - cleanup "merlin-process-started-p"
    - locate error messages were silently ignored, they are now printed
    - drop text properties from commands sent to merlin (pull request #383 by
      milanst)
    - Tell merlin the content of the buffer when opening a new buffer.
      This allows merlin idle-job to preload content if nothing else is
      requested.
    - remove call to merlin from the lighter

  vim:
    - fix ctrlp binding for locate
    - add (dwim) completion on :TypeOf
    - while completing, candidates documentation can be displayed in the
      "preview" window
    - prefix every command name by "Merlin" ( #379 )
    - Tell merlin the content of the buffer when opening a new buffer.
      This allows merlin idle-job to preload content if nothing else is
      requested.

merlin 2.1.2
============
Tue Mar  3 12:20:08 UTC 2015

  Main new feature is a faster short-path, and also a lot of buxfixes.

  backend:
    - merge new implementation of short-path
    - infrastructure for doing background computations
    - fix exhaustivity checking of GADTs
    - fix Typecore error reporting in 4.00.1 & 4.01.0
    - delayed checks are now enabled (e.g warnings)
    - special handling of "myocamlbuild.ml" (issue #363)
    - better sharing/caching of global modules
    - more customizable .merlin loading
    - minor fixes (better error messages, typos, "fake" extensions)

  build system:
    - allow bytecode builds, support OpenBSD (pull request #364 by madroach)
    - Refuse/Resist... environment variables redefinition

  vim:
    - fix charset/encoding detection (pull request #352 by rgrinberg)
    - minor fixes and simplification

  emacs:
    - better integration with emacs error management and asynchronous handling
    - expose custom .merlin loading in merlin-grouping-function
    - fixes, printf-debugging cleanup

merlin 2.1.1
============
Wed Jan 28 08:59:20 GMT 2015

  backend:
    - locate: merlin refused to locate things when it had no context (happens
      when the buffer didn't parse for example) claiming it was at the
      "definition point". Fixed.
    - locate: use the cmt path when no ml file was found in the source path
      (this might not be such a good idea, the cases when this work are the ones
      where the user configuration is wrong...)
    - destruct: qualify introduced constructors
    - destruct: eliminate "impossible" GADT branches
    - parser: handle '%' as an operator for 4.00 and 4.01 ( #345 )

  fake:
    - add typerep support
    - never generate ['_] type variables.

  vim:
    - show duplicated outlines in CtrlP
    - sort outlines by name length in CtrlP
    - when split method is set to 'tab' *always* open a new tab.

merlin 2.1
===========
Sun Jan 11 22:20:23 CET 2015

  backend:
    - add PPX support
    - make use of context before locating (#308, #316, #318).
    - generate match patterns for arbitrary expressions and missing patterns
      for incomplete matchings (#123).
    - reintroduce type expansion (asking the times of the same expression
      several times will resolve type aliases).
    - "smart" (a.k.a "do what I mean") completion:
          `L.m` will expand to `List.map ; List.m... ; ListLabels.map ; ...` if
          `L` doesn't exist.
    - simplify incremental parser and typer interfaces
    - locate: better handling of packed modules (supposedly)
    - more precise recovery on patterns (before the recovery was done at the
      expression level, so the whole match was discarded, now only the pattern
      is)

  emacs:
    - don't use fringe in emacs23 (broken)
    - remove obsolete aliases:
        merlin-occurences => merlin-occurrences
        merlin-to-end => merlin-error-check
    - disable merlin-mode on type buffer
    - require caml-types (needed for highlighting) (#331).

  misc:
    - update README (#301).

  vim:
    - add a type history buffer (#313, #322) -- only available for vim > 7.3.
    - highlight types when displaying them in the command line -- only for vim >
      7.3
    - add tab completion for the argument of the `:Locate` command
    - add support for text objects based on type enclosing
    - introduce an interactive version of `:Rename`
    - locate results can now be shown in a new or existing tab (#335)
    - use `fileencoding` where necessary (#332)
    - ctrlp bindings for outline and locate

This release also contains contributions from: Geoff Gole, Rudi Grinberg, Markus
Mottl, Roman Vorobets and Arthur Wendling.

merlin 2.0
==========
Fri Oct 31 11:04:21 CET 2014

This is a major release which we worked on for several months, rewriting many
parts of the codebase. An exhaustive list of changes is therefore impossible to
give, but here are some key points (from an user perspective):

  - support for OCaml 4.02.{0,1}
  - more precise recovery in presence of syntax errors
  - more user-friendly messages for syntax errors
  - locate now works on MLI files
  - automatic reloading of .merlin files (when they are update or created), it
    is no longer necessary to restart merlin
  - introduced a small refactoring command: rename, who renames all occurences
    of an identifier. See: http://yawdp.com/~def/rename.webm


This release also contains contributions from: Yotam Barnoy, Jacques-Pascal
Deplaix, Geoff Gole, Rudi Grinberg, Steve Purcell and Jan Rehders.

merlin 1.4.0
============
Tue Sep 24 23:02:04 BST 2013

  backend:
    - lazy processing of open directives makes merlin much faster
    - simplified buffer management
    - tweak signal handling to improve windows compatibility
    - track verbosity of query: repeated queries are considered more "verbose"
    - type expansion: expand type aliases for verbose query
    - add support for OUnit-like Benchmark extension
    - more tolerant type checker, to provide completion on ill-typed
      expressions
    - proper version reporting with git revision
    - refactored logging subsystem
    - add support "val constructs" in implementation: report errors but add
      definition to current environment
    - add FLG, EXT and PRJ in .merlin
    - "locate" command now works in much more situations
    - one distribution for 4.00 and 4.01, introduced common interface between
      both, typers now live in https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin-typers
    - new implementation of the main merlin state tracking ast & types
    - better error reporting thanks to a contribution from Ronan Lehy

  documentation:
    - started a wiki (https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin/wiki)
    - wrote 'from-scratch' guides to ease setting-up merlin in your editor

  emacs
    - during completion with auto-complete, you can hit C-c C-l on a candidate
      to jump on its definition
    - made communication with merlin asynchronous (using transfer queues) hence
      improving responsiveness
    - when running a merlin command, the errors present in all phrases but the
      current one are displayed
    - fixed buffer cleaning
    - successive call to C-c C-t do not climb the typed tree but improve merlin's
      verbosity. To move inside the tree use C-down and C-up (which implements
      phrase movement if there is no enclosing started).
    - customize data for merlin
    - refactoring and numerous bugfixes


merlin 1.3.1
============


  Minor release, but merlin is now compatible with ocaml versions > 4.00.1.
  The only noticeable changes since 1.3 is the use of short paths even with
  version 4.00.1 of ocaml.

merlin 1.3
==========

  backend:
    - added a "locate" command to find the definition location of the given

    - add support for "type nonrec" declaration
    - add support for "with compare" from type-conv
    - add partial support for "with fields" from type-conv

  misc:
