* cloud-to-butt-erc

In the spirit of [[https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt][the cloud-to-butt extension for Chrome]] here is a
cloud-to-butt module for ERC.  This will replace all instances of the
phrase 'the cloud' with 'my butt'.  Also, by default, as this is
interpersonal communication, the replaced instances are surrounded by
the ~ character so there is less confusion about why people keep
mentioning their butts.

You can disable this behavior with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq cloud-to-butt-replacement-decoration "")
#+END_SRC

** Installation
*** Via Package.el (recommended)
Add Marmalade or Melpa as a package archive source 
in ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

or

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

Then you can install it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET cloud-to-butt-erc RET
#+END_SRC

*** Manually (via git)
Download the source or clone the repo and add the following 
to ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/cloud-to-butt-erc")
(require 'cloud-to-butt-erc)
#+END_EXAMPLE
