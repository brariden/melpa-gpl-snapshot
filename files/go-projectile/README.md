## Synopsis

**Go Projectile** is a set of Go language related add-ons for
the Emacs [Projectile](http://batsov.com/projectile/) mode.

## Configuration

```lisp
(require 'go-projectile)
```

## Usage

After running `projectile-switch-project` (<kbd>C-c p s</kbd>) the features of
`go-projectile` will be (optionally) enabled.

### Managing GOPATH

Rather than have a global GOPATH set in your .bashrc or similar, go-projectile
makes it easier for each project to have their own GOPATH automatically
configured.  Upon switching to a projectile project, the GOPATH environment
variable will be set appropriately, see `go-projectile-switch-gopath`.
The `go-projectile-set-gopath` function can also be called directly, without
using `projectile-switch-project`.

### Go tools

Most of the Emacs Go packages have hard or soft dependencies on
programs installed via `go get`, such as `gocode`, `godef`, etc.
You can install the complete set of `go-projectile-tools` using:
<kbd>M-x go-projectile-install-tools</kbd>
And update the tools using: <kbd>M-x go-projectile-update-tools</kbd>
These tools are installed within their own GOPATH, configurable via
the `go-projectile-tools-path` variable.

### Searching

Run `vc-git-grep` on `*.go` in the `$GOPATH/src/` directory of the
current buffer using `go-projectile-git-grep` (<kbd>C-c p G</kbd>).

Useful for use within multi-language projects and/or repositories that
include vendored packages.

### Importing projects

Create a new projectile project via `go-projectile-get` (<kbd>C-c p N</kbd>).
This function will 'go get' an existing repo and switch to the new project.

### Refactoring

Renaming of Go identifiers is available via `go-rename` (<kbd>C-c p w</kbd>).

Very basic refactoring is made available via `go-projectile-rewrite` (<kbd>C-c p W</kbd>).
It is just a wrapper around `gofmt -r`, where go-projectile tries to help
generate the rewrite pattern based on the cursor's location.  The rewrite rule
will only apply to '*.go' files in the current project, excluding patterns
listed in `go-project-files-ignore'.
