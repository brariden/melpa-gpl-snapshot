Elisp 実装の編集可能な再帰 grep

interactively-editable recursive grep implementation in elisp

** Screencast

[[screencast.gif]]

** Usage

Require this script

: (require 'phi-grep)

then following commands are available.

- phi-grep-in-file :: grep in a single file
- phi-grep-in-directory :: recursive grep in a directory tree

in dired-mode buffers, following commands are available in addition.

- phi-grep-dired-in-dir-at-point :: grep in a directory at point
- phi-grep-dired-in-file-at-point :: grep in a file at point
- phi-grep-dired-in-marked-files :: grep in all marked files
- phi-grep-dired-in-all-files :: grep in all listed files
- phi-grep-dired-dwim :: automatically choose one of above

You can exit phi-grep with one of [C-g] or [RET]. [C-g] will jump you
back to the original position where phi-grep is invoked, and [RET]
does not.

You can optionally edit the result of grep, and you will asked whether
to commit changes or not.

** Advantages

- Implemented in pure Elisp.

  - phi-grep can also search in opened buffers (not only files on the
    disk), thus the result can reflect unsaved changes.

  - phi-grep does not depends on the external command "grep". So you
    can do grep-and-edit on every OS that Emacs can run on.

- Result is editable INTERACTIVELY with preview.

- Result is consistent even when you edit some parts of matched files
  after phi-grep.
