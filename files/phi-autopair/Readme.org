* phi-autopair.el

another simple-minded autopair implementation (insert/delete parens
automatically).

括弧の自動挿入・削除

** Features

- Automatically insert close parens

  [[screencasts/paren.gif]]

  A close paren is automatically inserted on insertion of an open
  paren. When an open paren is inserted with the mark active, the
  region is wrapped with parens. String quotes are escaped if
  necessary.

- Automatically insert whitespaces in LISP-like languages

  [[screencasts/whitespace.gif]]

  In LISP-like languages, whitespaces are inserted in addition.

- Smart delete commands powered by "paredit.el"

  [[screencasts/deletion.gif]]

  + deleting paren from inside also deletes the partner paren, even
    when some contents are between them

  + deleting paren from outside does not deletes the partner paren, so
    that you can restore the balance manually

  + both escape character and the escaped character are deleted at a
    time

  + all adjacent whitespaces are deleted at a time (hungry-deletion)

  Still you can disable some of them.

** Other Advantages

- Better compatibility with other plug-ins (multiple-cursors, for
  example)

  Many plug-ins use post/pre-command-hook to modify existing commands'
  behaviors. The hook is useful, but plug-ins heavily depend on the
  hook sometimes cause some conflictions with other plug-ins in the
  hook.

  This plug-in just defines few new commands: insert commands and
  delete commands, and binds some keys to the commands. Thus not
  depends on the hook, and has better compatibility with other
  plug-ins.

- Works with all languages without any settings

  Settings are automatically generated from the syntax-table, thus it
  works without any settings as long as the major-mode is implemented
  correctly.

- Supports non-ASCII parens (like «»)

** Disadvantages

- Overrides keybinds for some keys

  Instead of using hooks to modify existing commands, this plug-in
  defines new commands and binds some keys to them.

- Cannot handle multi-char parens (like "begin" and "end")

  This plug-in uses syntax-table provided by the major-mode to
  recognize parens, thus cannot handle multi-char parens. If you need
  multi-char parens support, you may try "smartparens.el".

- Depends on "paredit.el"

  You need to download it before loading this plug-in.

** Usage

Put phi-autopair.el *and paredit.el*
([[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit]]) in a "load-path"ed directory,
and require this script.

: (require 'phi-autopair)

To enable phi-autopair in the current buffer, call command
=phi-autopair-mode=. If you want to enable =phi-autopair-mode=
(almost) everywhere, call =phi-autopair-global-mode= instead.

: (phi-autopair-global-mode)

** Customizable variables

- phi-autopair-auto-insert-pairs
- phi-autopair-auto-wrap-region
- phi-autopair-auto-delete-pairs
- phi-autopair-auto-delete-spaces
